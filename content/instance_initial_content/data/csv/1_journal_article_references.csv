Mary Poulton Dawkins, an early benefactor of this church, who was born in England, was thought by many to have been the link in securing plans from London for the present building. More careful research reveals that the South Carolina building is virtually identical to St. Anne's Chapel at Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, designed by Frank Wills, an English architect from Exeter. Involved with the ""Oxford movement,"" which sought to bring about a renewal within the Church of England, Wills gave architectural expression to the movement's ideals. Wills later moved to New York to establish an architectural firm. The Reverend John DeWitt McCollough, who was known in South Carolina for the organization and construction of many church buildings during the 1840's-50's, knew of Wills's work in designing church buildings. Thus, it appears more probable that McCollough received the plans from Wills, instead of through Mary Dawkins.","1999-07","2019-02-06 19:04:59","2019-02-06 19:04:59","","241-254","","3","100","","South Carolina Historical Magazine","","","","","","","","","","","ahl","","EBSCOhost","","","<p>Accession Number: 46005940; Pearson, Lennart; Source Info: Jul1999, Vol. 100 Issue 3, p241; Note: Based on the McLure Family Papers, South Carolinian Library, University of South Carolina, periodicals, other primary sources, and secondary sources; 2 illus., 3 photos, 34 notes.; Historical Period: 1840 to 1849; Subject Term: CHURCH buildings; Subject Term: ARCHITECTURE; Number of Pages: 14p; Document Type: Article</p>; <p>Accession Number: 46005940; Pearson, Lennart; Source Info: Jul1999, Vol. 100 Issue 3, p241; Note: Based on the McLure Family Papers, South Carolinian Library, University of South Carolina, periodicals, other primary sources, and secondary sources; 2 illus., 3 photos, 34 notes.; Historical Period: 1840 to 1849; Subject Term: CHURCH buildings; Subject Term: ARCHITECTURE; Number of Pages: 14p; Document Type: Article</p>","","","CHURCH buildings; ARCHITECTURE; DAWKINS, Mary Poulton, 1820-1906; McCollough, John DeWitt; South Carolina (Union); WILLS, Frank","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They also recognized Christ as head of both church and state, believed in supreme scriptural authority, and were distrustful of the Anglican Church and therefore critical of episcopacy. Reformed Presbyterian communities were founded in the Maritimes in the 1820's and 1830's. Other groups of Covenanter communities were founded slightly later in Upper Canada (Ontario) and Lower Canada (Quebec), and a group of congregations in western Canada was founded by Americans in the first two decades of the 20th century. In the Maritimes the movement lasted approximately one hundred years, and there are still four or five small congregations in the Ottawa Valley. James Reid Lawson (1820-91) came from Ireland in 1845 and was pastor in Southstream (later Barnesville), New Brunswick, until his death. Alexander Clarke (1794-1874) was the first Irish Reformed Presbyterian missionary to come to the Lower Provinces.

One alternative parish model is a team ministry model. Team ministries are characterized by more than one person in the position of leadership carrying out ministry in overlapping roles in the same parish environment, functioning in a non-hierarchical manner. The goal of the research was to learn how team ministries may be better formed and maintained in the future. This thesis opens by identifying sources which can provide insight about how team ministries may be better formed and maintained. It looks at writings from the early Church (particularly parts of the New Testament), and practices of ""team ministry"" in other Anglican provinces. It also draws from the field of Occupational Psychology. The bulk of the research for this thesis was a grounded theory qualitative research study, undertaken among participants in team ministries in two Anglican dioceses. The research was distilled into five broad categories: Dispositions, Theological Perspectives and Traits; Ordination and Team Formation; Parishes; Social and Spiritual Disciplines; and Support Beyond the Parish. Key research results are that potential team ministers need to have reasonably compatible theological perspectives and dispositions, and reasonably good emotional intelligence. The research identifies some general traits which ought to be present among team ministers. The parish(es) and the team ministers need to prepare for this ministry (including long-term planning), with external support. The team ministry relationship needs on-going attention, particularly the process of communication. Particular attention also needs to be taken for the relationships which include Non-Stipendiary Ordained Ministers (N.S.O.M.), as these clergy are raised up from the local parish and generally serve there throughout their ministries.","2015","2019-02-06 19:04:59","2019-02-06 19:04:59","2018-08-21 14:49:02","","294","","","","","Team Ministries in Anglican Parishes in the Maritime Provinces of Canada","","","","","Wycliffe College and University of Toronto (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","D.Min.","","","ProQuest","","","","","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Anglican Church; Canadian Maritime provinces; Team ministries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This duality determined that Neo-Gothic architecture would achieve its greatest expression in and through the Church. This was particularly so in New Brunswick. Nineteenth century New Brunswick was a relatively self contained society. As such, the province serves as a convenient case in point for measuring the impact of Neo-Gothic ideas and forms on a particular group of people. Under the tutelage of Anglican Bishop John Medley, there occurred a gradual shift in religious aesthetics. Medley was the first prominent British ecclesiologist to assume a colonial see. With a singleminded sense of purpose, he resolutely transferred the Gothic creed from Oxford and Cambridge to the communities and countryside of his new diocese. The Church of England was clearly the object of his efforts, but judging from New Brunswickers' almost universal shift from Georgian to Gothic forms during the third quarter of the century, Medley's ideas had considerable impact beyond the province's Anglican community. By the turn of the century there was not a mainstreet in New Brunswick untouched by the Gothic Revival. In this British colony as elsewhere, the Anglican bishop effectively transplanted something of the Mother Country into the local community. Medley's unrelenting Neo-Gothic programme was made manifest in the scores of new churches built throughout the diocese. They came to personify England's faith, England's culture and England's empire. Here, in this juxtaposition of loyalties--to religious values, to cultural sentiments and to an imperial ideal--does one find the key to a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the Gothic Revival in New Brunswick history. Indeed, after Medley's arrival in 1845, New Brunswick became a proving ground for a significant chapter in Canadian architectural and religious history.","1989","2019-02-06 19:04:59","2019-02-06 19:04:59","2018-08-21 13:44:51","","90","","","","","New Brunswick's Gothic revival","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; Church of England; Communication and the arts; John; Medley","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"MB2UIXT8","thesis","2016","Walker, Peter W.","The Church Militant: The American Loyalist Clergy and the Making of the British Counterrevolution, 1701-92","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/pqdtglobal/docview/1831434724/abstract/47EF72FABB9E499APQ/135","This dissertation is a study of the loyalist Church of England clergy in the American Revolution. By reconstructing the experience and identity of this largely-misunderstood group, it sheds light on the relationship between church and empire, the role of religious pluralism and toleration in the American Revolution, the dynamics of loyalist politics, and the religious impact of the American Revolution on Britain. It is based primarily on the loyalist clergy’s own correspondence and writings, the records of the American Loyalist Claims Commission, and the archives of the SPG (the Church of England’s missionary arm). This dissertation focuses on the New England and Mid-Atlantic colonies, where Anglicans formed a religious minority and where their clergy were overwhelmingly loyalist. It begins with the founding of the SPG in 1701 and its first forays into America. It then examines the state of religious pluralism and toleration in New England, the polarising contest over the proposed creation of an American bishop after the Seven Years’ War, and the role of the loyalist clergy in the Revolutionary War itself, focusing particularly on conflicts occasioned by the Anglican liturgy and Book of Common Prayer. The dissertation proceeds to follow those loyalist clergy who left the Thirteen Colonies as refugees, tracing their reception in Britain, their influence on conservative churchmen there, and their role in rebuilding the imperial Church of England in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Particular attention is given to the relationship between the loyalist refugees, the English high church movement, and the Scottish Episcopal church. Bridging British, Canadian, and colonial American history, it suggests that the American Revolution galvanised an Anglican religious revival in the British Empire and shaped an emerging alliance between the Church of England and conservative politics. It ends in the 1790s, as this alliance solidified under the influence of the French Revolution. Most scholarship on religion and the American Revolution is ultimately concerned with the politics of the revolution. This dissertation, by contrast, asks how the politics of the revolution affected the religious lives of those who lived through it. It provides a sympathetic account of the loyalist clergy’s religious identities and beliefs, and situates them in the context of early-modern British religious history. In doing so, it reconstructs a distinct spiritual culture which was concerned with the holiness of suffering, persecution, and martyrdom. It locates the clergy’s loyalism in the longer history of political martyrdom, a category that has been overlooked by secular-minded historians of loyalism. The loyalist clergy were also preoccupied with the lack of state support for the colonial Church of England. Together with their allies and sympathizers in Britain, they formulated a powerful critique of the British Empire’s religious pluralism: an important but overlooked contribution to counter-enlightenment and counter-revolutionary thought in Britain. By studying that critique, this dissertation highlights the limits of state support for the colonial Church of England prior to the American Revolution, and identifies a turn towards greater state support in the wake of American independence.","2016","2019-02-06 19:04:59","2019-02-06 19:04:59","2018-08-21 13:58:41","","330","","","","","The Church Militant","","","","","Columbia University","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","","","","Social sciences; American Revolution; British Empire; Church of England; Loyalism; Martyrdom; Refugees","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
