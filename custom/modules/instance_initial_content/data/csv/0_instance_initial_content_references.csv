"QSK5GJP2","thesis","1997","Maxwell, Arthur Wesley","Beliefs concerning the doctrine of entire sanctification held by lay full members of the Atlantic District of the Wesleyan Church","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/pqdtglobal/docview/304414289/abstract/47EF72FABB9E499APQ/27","The purpose of this study has been to identify and describe the beliefs concerning the doctrine of entire sanctification currently held by lay full members of the Atlantic District of The Wesleyan Church. The Wesleyan Church has a rich heritage in Methodism and can trace its roots back to eighteenth century England and Methodism's founder, John Wesley. Wesley stressed the doctrine of entire sanctification and taught that all believers could experience a clean heart filled with perfect love in this life. This doctrine was successfully transplanted into early American Methodism and subsequently into The Wesleyan Church. The Atlantic District of The Wesleyan Church has not always been a part of this rich Methodist heritage. Until 1966, this district was an independent denomination known as The Alliance of The Reformed Baptist Church of Canada. The Reformed Baptists organized as a denomination in Woodstock, New Brunswick, November 3, 1888, as a result of the disfellowshipping of five ministers of The Free Christian Baptist Church for preaching and teaching the doctrine of entire sanctification. In July, 1966, The Reformed Baptist Church merged with The Wesleyan Methodist Church (now The Wesleyan Church) and became The Atlantic District of that denomination. The qualitative paradigm and case study design was selected as the most appropriate methodology for meeting the requirements of this study. A random sample of forty lay full members was selected from a representative case selected within The Atlantic District of The Wesleyan Church. Guided interviews were conducted with participants in order to determine their views on various aspects of the doctrine of entire sanctification. The data reveals that only 55% of lay full members in the representative case profess to be entirely sanctified. Seventy-two percent of participants state that preaching is the major contributor to their understanding of this doctrine. From the data it is also evident that there is a general lack of understanding of the doctrine of entire sanctification among lay full members of the representative case in The Atlantic District.","1997","2018-11-01 17:54:13","2018-11-01 17:54:13","2018-08-21 13:29:19","","179","","","","","","","","","","Canadian Theological Seminary (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","D.Min.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/34LVFJBF/Maxwell - 1997 - Beliefs concerning the doctrine of entire sanctifi.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present article explores the advantages and limitations of such data by analyzing the evolution of key church indicators of the United Church of Canada over the past four decades. Figures regarding church membership, child baptisms, and funerals are examined and compared with demographic data from four Canadian regions. Results show that virtually all United Church statistics are in decline with regard to larger society since the 1970s. However, there are regional variations, most notably in the Atlantic provinces, which show later and lesser rates of decline.

The women undertook preaching, teaching and medical duties there. From the Maritime Provinces to Sichuan is not only a lengthy geographic distance; there were also major differences between the two social and cultural situations. Sichuan was traditionally called ""Shu"". There is a famous verse describing the road to Sichuan: the road to Shu is as hard as the road to heaven. However, like missionaries of the previous generation, A. Jean L. Stewart, Katharine B. Hockin and Grace M. Webster set their feet on the hard road to Shu. Why did these women choose to become missionaries in that very remote corner of the world? What did they do there and what kind of interactions took place during their years of work? In order to address the questions mentioned above, the thesis approaches the three women through their life stories. They were members of the second generation of women missionaries who were sent to overseas missions after the UCC was established in 1925.","1993","2018-11-01 17:54:02","2018-11-01 17:54:02","2018-08-21 14:20:19","","144","","","","","","","","","","Saint Mary's University (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/8AQSDVQT/Song - 1993 - A study of three women missionaries of the United .pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; A.

Language problems rendered missionary work difficult, and French priests wrote that the Irish had less religious education and seemed to prefer Protestantism.

Collegiate administrators sought to contain student nationalism and reaffirm unity with reference to Britain, sometimes by fostering common resentment to British colonialism and at other times by encouraging monarchist sympathy.

Amanda Viger was a founder of the order's primary and most precarious New Brunswick foundation. This thesis traces the life of Amanda Viger from her birth in Boucherville, Quebec, in 1845, to her death in the Hotel-Dieu, Arthabaska, Quebec, in 1906. The major part of the work centers on her career in Tracadie, where she and five others established a foundation in 1868. The Hospitallers were called to look after leprosy victims sequestered in a lazaretto hospital. Viger, a trained pharmacist, remained in Tracadie for 34 years, and occupied nearly all of the highest offices in that community. She was elected mother superior five times. The work examines the extent to which the deeply Catholic spirituality which infused her life from her earliest days also directed her in her choice of vocation, and determined her success. It demonstrates that, while much of what Amanda Viger did in religious life was motivated by Catholic spirituality, she also was often influenced by her own perceptions of what was right and what should happen.

The focus of my research is to explore how women who appear to adhere to Catholic tradition, practices, and rituals identify with the religious traditions, and how they view the traditions of their Church with respect to modern societal norms. In addition, women who do not observe the teachings, traditions, or practices of their Church are asked how they negotiate those regulations, and what maintains their commitment to their religious tradition. My research extends to consider how Catholic women reconcile the traditions of their Church with seemingly contradictory values that are rooted in the principles of gender parity. Findings indicate that Catholic women create religious meaning beyond institutional practices and Church doctrines. Furthermore, women's religious meaning is intertwined within public and private realms of religion, and is interconnected with feminist values as well as traditional religious practices.","2007","2018-11-01 17:53:37","2018-11-01 17:53:37","2018-08-21 15:19:35","","166","","","","","Sifting through Catholic tradition","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/B59ZTAS8/McKillop - 2007 - Sifting through Catholic tradition Catholic women.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On July 25, 1869, the first Catholic hospital in the Province of New Brunswick was founded at Chatham by the Religious Hospitallers of Saint Joseph. This marked the beginning of a one-hundred-and-thirty year tradition of caring for and healing the sick. Subsequently, other religious institutes of women founded and administered health care facilities throughout New Brunswick, ranging from hospitals to nursing schools to homes for the aged. At the heart of the Church's health care apostolate lays the affirmation of the dignity of the human person and the strong commitment to give concrete expression to the gospel mandate ""to heal the sick."" In March 1992, the provincial health minister announced an overhaul of the health care system in New Brunswick. This legislation threatened the Church's integral mission of providing health care in the Province. The Hospital Act of 1992 terminated unilaterally the collaboration, cooperation and partnership between Government and Church in the area of health care. The take-over of the Catholic hospitals, the dissolution of the individual hospital boards, the establishment of seven regional hospital corporations, challenged and even denied the Church's right to be involved in the health care delivery system. Obviously, this legislation proved unsatisfactory to the religious institutes owning hospitals in the Province, to the bishops and to the New Brunswick Catholic Health Association. On April 21, 1993, after nearly a year of negotiations, an Agreement was reached whereby Catholic hospital facilities in the Province would continue to be owned by the religious institutes. While administration and control of these same facilities would come under the authority of a regional hospital corporation, provisions were introduced to safeguard Catholic mission, values, philosophy and ethics in these hospitals. The Hospital Act of 1992 was also amended so as to include these guarantees, while, at the same time, establishing Advisory Committees for each of the Catholic hospitals in the Province. These Committees would be the mechanism assuring the protection and promotion of the Catholicity of the hospital facilities. The canonical status of the Catholic hospitals in New Brunswick has been definitively altered in New Brunswick by the provincial legislation of 1992. However, other health care facilities continue to be owned, administered and controlled by religious in the Province. These facilities make visible in a tangible way the presence of the Healing One who issued the command nearly two thousand years to care for and heal the sick. Canon Law provides the necessary provisions to assist and enhance this apostolic endeavour.","1998","2018-11-01 17:53:37","2018-11-01 17:53:37","2018-08-21 13:12:12","","376","","","","","","","","","","University of Ottawa (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/EYUHXEL3/McGowan - 1998 - The canonical status of Catholic health care facil.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; New Brunswick; Canonical; Catholic; Health and environmental sciences; Health care facilities; Legislation; Provincial government","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The establishment of diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1969 marked the culmination of a century of bitter debate on the question, which had traditionally pitted the federal government against various groups opposed to such a move, primarily Canadian Protestants. While the government and opposition groups appeared deadlocked for much of the first half of the twentieth century, opposition had withered considerably by 1969. The Quiet Revolution, the Second Vatican Council and the social unrest of the 1960's had functioned to alter Canadian society in profound and permanent ways, abating certain ancestral tensions while creating others. By 1969, it appeared that Catholic-Protestant hostilities, a traditional barrier to the diplomatic recognition of the Vatican, were considerably lessened by the events of the 1950's and 1960's. This study examines Canadian-Vatican relations in the postwar period through an examination of diplomatic, governmental and ecclesiastical records. While it is primarily a diplomatic history of this relationship, elements of social and political history will be examined to assist in explaining how such a diplomatic link, which had aroused so much controversy for nearly a century, was established with only token opposition in 1969.","2005","2018-11-01 17:53:37","2018-11-01 17:53:37","2018-08-21 13:32:11","","117","","","","","","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/F2VLRK8E/Ciani - 2005 - The establishment of diplomatic relations between .pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Language; literature and linguistics; Social sciences; Italy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the discipline of folklore, but with an awareness of the contributions of history and anthropology, it explores both positive and negative depictions of the priest's role as religious and cultural leader, community icon, hero and villain. The thesis argues that these complex folkloric representations express a nuanced ""counterclericalism"" that extends the concept of ""anticlericalism"" as developed by anthropologists and historians, and that communally accepted counterclerical narratives create a venue for discourse on the nature of power in general. I propose that the term counterclericalism is better suited to the folkloristic study of vernacular expressions of criticism of clergy, suggesting that the term ""anticlericalism"" be reserved for other uses.","2012","2018-11-01 17:53:37","2018-11-01 17:53:37","2018-08-21 13:45:32","","228","","","","","Counterclericalism","","","","","Memorial University of Newfoundland (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/T5QBTPVB/McDavid - 2012 - Counterclericalism Vernacular Commentary on the P.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; New Brunswick; Catholic; Counterclericalism; Newfoundland and Labrador; Nova Scotia; Priest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The nascent community struggled marginally during the first half of the century but by the end of the 1800s Acadians had become much more self-confident and self-assertive. With the ferment of Acadian national enthusiasms after 1880 there arose a movement to undermine what Acadians saw as Irish and Scottish hegemony within the regional Catholic Church. Those efforts culminated in 1912 with the naming of Edouard-Alfred LeBlanc as Acadian bishop, the first to occupy an episcopal see in Maritime Canada. In their lobby for a bishop, Acadians had insisted that their status within regional society would be greatly enhanced by the presence of this figure who would afford much needed leadership. Bishop LeBlanc's twenty-three year career as prelate of the Saint John See resulted in an expansion of Acadian religious institutions within Roman Catholic society often causing bitter resentment among the English-speaking clergy and hierarchy. Yet at the same time LeBlanc's leadership, when called upon to act on broader issues confronting Maritime society as a whole, tended to lose its innovation and conform with popular opinion, even at the expense of Acadian ambitions. That cautious approach not to challenge the views of the majority nor those of its elected officials made LeBlanc a man motivated by the accepted conventions of his time.","1992","2018-11-01 17:53:37","2018-11-01 17:53:37","2018-08-21 15:31:04","","412","","","","","Acadian nationalism and the episcopacy of Msgr.

What reasons motivated the Acadian elite to refuse Confederation while the Catholic Church and the French Canadians saw it as an advantageous repositioning?

The American author made no reference to Canada’s war efforts. The subsequent public discussion focused on issues of patriotism, citizenship, history education and schooling, but it eventually dissolved into longstanding conflicts over language and religion. This case study investigates how questions about history education were interpreted through the lens of the political partisanship of the newspaper editor, the bureaucratic rationality of the educational administrator, and the Acadian nationalism of the Roman Catholic Bishop. The controversy depicts a loosening but not breaking of postcolonial ties, and uncovers the political nature of public memory, along with the complex intertwining of religion and language rights within schooling, history education and citizenship in post-war Canada and New Brunswick.

In the 1840's voters selected candidates on the basis of individual merit, although patterns based on religion and place of origin could be discerned.

Six focus group discussions with a total of forty four participants and personal interviews with seventeen Catholic women and six religious leaders in New Brunswick revealed that the particular social concerns of Catholic women and the ways in which they address these concerns are dependent on a variety of religious and social factors. These factors included the socio-economic context of their churches, family situations, career, role models, involvement in faith organizations, and the quality of social action leadership. Increased engagement in the work of social change could be achieved through a strengthened cooperation of clergy and laity.","2009","2018-11-01 17:51:01","2018-11-01 17:51:01","2018-08-21 13:52:21","","190","","","","","Heart, mind and soul","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/4SXAGJNY/Holtman - 2009 - Heart, mind and soul Catholic women and social ac.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, the lives of Catholic women are also influenced by other factors, ones that are predominantly secular in nature, such as occupational attainment, advanced education and the principles of modern feminism. This research explores how Catholic women negotiate between their lives and Catholic teaching. Through in-depth interviews with a small sample of twenty Roman Catholic women, this thesis examines how such women incorporate both religious rhetoric and the messages of contemporary secular culture into their lives and how they resolve conflict amidst the various voices about what is, or should be, important to them. Throughout the analysis, it is revealed that Catholic women re-construct and re-interpret Roman Catholic teaching on the Virgin Mary, sexuality and motherhood to better reflect their modern circumstances. By these means, Catholic teaching continues to play an important role in the lives of contemporary Catholic women. The women in this study were not hesitant to reveal differences between ideology of what it means to be a ""good Catholic woman"" and the actual practice that enabled the Catholic women interviewed for this thesis to pursue their faith in spite of the discrepancies it presented within their own lives.","1998","2018-11-01 17:51:01","2018-11-01 17:51:01","2018-08-21 14:26:03","","138","","","","","Mary, Mary quite submissive","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/BFXN99VF/Spencer - 1998 - Mary, Mary quite submissive An analysis of Cathol.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But a set of interviews with 94 Baptist and Wesleyan women from Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and New Brunswick revealed that evangelical women held a spectrum of attitudes toward feminism, from condemnation to affirmation. It is important to remember that evangelical women played a crucial role in ""first wave"" feminism during the 19th century. Therefore, while central objectives of the modern feminist movement such as abortion rights remained abhorrent to evangelical women, feminists who view all evangelicals as antifeminist display a destructive form of feminist elitism and ignore an important source of support.","1997-09","2018-11-01 17:51:01","2018-11-01 17:51:01","","9-18","","1","22","","Atlantis: Critical Studies in Gender, Culture & Social Justice / Études Critiques sur le Genre, la Culture, et la Justice","","","","","","","","","","","ahl","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","CANADA; ATLANTIC Provinces; ATTITUDE (Psychology); EVANGELICALISM; FEMINISM; INTERVIEWING; WOMEN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their reform work with its social purity emphasis represented an expanded temperance ideology, which pushed their social mandate beyond the boundaries set by earlier temperance organizations. Together their contemporary methods and ideas enabled them to influence the middle-class and gender ideals of the period. Working as a regional force, the Maritime WCTU was successful especially in the work of children's character formation programs. They were able to gain the support and assistance of the state and religious authoritative bodies, the government and the church, to implement compulsory scientific temperance teaching in the public schools and gospel temperance teaching in many of the evangelical Sunday schools. Their juvenile work, with its contemporary pedagogical techniques and broad temperance message, extended the teaching of temperate life choices to Maritime children through leisure-time activities. The popular Maritime mothers' meetings, with its strong eugenics' emphasis, worked to equip mothers' with proper knowledge and skills to help them build temperate families. As the nineteenth century drew to a close, it became apparent that their individual reform programs were part of a larger nationalistic social vision, the establishment of a temperate Canada. The Maritime WCTU fought for woman's suffrage in the anticipation that it would allow them to further advance and expand their reform work.","2001","2018-11-01 17:51:01","2018-11-01 17:51:01","2018-08-21 13:39:11","","186","","","","","The Maritime Woman's Christian Temperance Union, 1875–1895","","","","","Saint Mary's University (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/MIZ6M2EE/Willigar - 2001 - The Maritime Woman's Christian Temperance Union, 1.pdf","","","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Women enlivened the interior with specimens of nature, handmade fancywork and living organisms. By imbuing nature with religious significance and cultural meaning, women were able to rationalize their interest in the outdoors and give purpose to their endeavors. They found inspiration in scientific writings and religious works, including imported journals and ladies' magazines. As women embraced responsibility for interior decoration within their ""separate sphere"" of the home, they cultivated a comfortable retreat from the vicissitudes of a competitive masculine business world. The enigmatic multidimensional linkages between religion and science, business and home, personal Christianity and domestic aesthetics, as well as faith and feeling are touched upon in this article by using material artifacts as cultural evidence.","1993-06","2018-11-01 17:51:01","2018-11-01 17:51:01","","36-49","","38","","","Material History Review","","","","","","","","","","","ahl","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","CANADA; MARITIME Provinces; WOMEN; INTERIOR decoration; NATURE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There was, however, no tradition of female preaching in Protestant churches in the region. The evidence indicates that there was resistance to preaching by women as early as the 1830's and that the practice declined over the century. Although isolated instances of female preaching in the Maritimes continued throughout the 19th century, women themselves accepted the notion that preaching was essentially a part of the male sphere.","2001-03","2018-11-01 17:51:01","2018-11-01 17:51:01","","3-39","","2","30","","Acadiensis","","","","","","","","","","","ahl","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","CANADA; MARITIME Provinces; WOMEN; GENDER role; PREACHING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This duality determined that Neo-Gothic architecture would achieve its greatest expression in and through the Church. This was particularly so in New Brunswick. Nineteenth century New Brunswick was a relatively self contained society. As such, the province serves as a convenient case in point for measuring the impact of Neo-Gothic ideas and forms on a particular group of people. Under the tutelage of Anglican Bishop John Medley, there occurred a gradual shift in religious aesthetics. Medley was the first prominent British ecclesiologist to assume a colonial see. With a singleminded sense of purpose, he resolutely transferred the Gothic creed from Oxford and Cambridge to the communities and countryside of his new diocese. The Church of England was clearly the object of his efforts, but judging from New Brunswickers' almost universal shift from Georgian to Gothic forms during the third quarter of the century, Medley's ideas had considerable impact beyond the province's Anglican community. By the turn of the century there was not a mainstreet in New Brunswick untouched by the Gothic Revival. In this British colony as elsewhere, the Anglican bishop effectively transplanted something of the Mother Country into the local community. Medley's unrelenting Neo-Gothic programme was made manifest in the scores of new churches built throughout the diocese. They came to personify England's faith, England's culture and England's empire. Here, in this juxtaposition of loyalties--to religious values, to cultural sentiments and to an imperial ideal--does one find the key to a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the Gothic Revival in New Brunswick history. Indeed, after Medley's arrival in 1845, New Brunswick became a proving ground for a significant chapter in Canadian architectural and religious history.","1989","2018-11-01 17:52:07","2018-11-01 17:52:07","2018-08-21 13:44:51","","90","","","","","New Brunswick's Gothic revival","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/VY92CTE2/Finley - 1989 - New Brunswick's Gothic revival John Medley and th.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; Church of England; Communication and the arts; John; Medley","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One alternative parish model is a team ministry model. Team ministries are characterized by more than one person in the position of leadership carrying out ministry in overlapping roles in the same parish environment, functioning in a non-hierarchical manner. The goal of the research was to learn how team ministries may be better formed and maintained in the future. This thesis opens by identifying sources which can provide insight about how team ministries may be better formed and maintained. It looks at writings from the early Church (particularly parts of the New Testament), and practices of ""team ministry"" in other Anglican provinces. It also draws from the field of Occupational Psychology. The bulk of the research for this thesis was a grounded theory qualitative research study, undertaken among participants in team ministries in two Anglican dioceses. The research was distilled into five broad categories: Dispositions, Theological Perspectives and Traits; Ordination and Team Formation; Parishes; Social and Spiritual Disciplines; and Support Beyond the Parish. Key research results are that potential team ministers need to have reasonably compatible theological perspectives and dispositions, and reasonably good emotional intelligence. The research identifies some general traits which ought to be present among team ministers. The parish(es) and the team ministers need to prepare for this ministry (including long-term planning), with external support. The team ministry relationship needs on-going attention, particularly the process of communication. Particular attention also needs to be taken for the relationships which include Non-Stipendiary Ordained Ministers (N.S.O.M.), as these clergy are raised up from the local parish and generally serve there throughout their ministries.","2015","2018-11-01 17:52:07","2018-11-01 17:52:07","2018-08-21 14:49:02","","294","","","","","Team Ministries in Anglican Parishes in the Maritime Provinces of Canada","","","","","Wycliffe College and University of Toronto (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","D.Min.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/L2L3GM8N/Armstrong - 2015 - Team Ministries in Anglican Parishes in the Mariti.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Anglican Church; Canadian Maritime provinces; Team ministries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most Maritime Baptists belonged to the modernist United Baptist Convention, which in the late 1920's was increasingly threatened by the rising tide of fundamentalism. In the 1930's, the main challenge to the Convention came from the fundamentalist preacher John James Sidey (1891-1966), who headed a breakaway Baptist group. Sidey, however, failed to attract significant numbers of Convention Baptists. He was not a Maritimer, was not really familiar with the history and religious legacy of the Maritime Baptists, and had to contend with a vigorous counteroffensive by Convention leaders.","1987","2018-11-01 17:52:33","2018-11-01 17:52:33","","3-33","","1","17","","Acadiensis","","","","","","","","","","","ahl","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","CANADA; MARITIME Provinces; BAPTISTS; MODERNISM (Aesthetics); PROTESTANT fundamentalism; Sidey, John James","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The central focus of this thesis is upon a number of key leaders within the Convention whose contemplation of the theological and practical aspects of the issue helped provide the impetus for the Convention's formal adoption of a pro-life stance. The changing of leadership within the Convention during the latter half of the twentieth century, from moderate liberal to conservative also impacted the way the abortion issue was viewed. A transition occurs between the first attempt by the Board of Social Service to address the abortion issue which led to the moderately liberal orientation of 1973 Study Paper on Abortion, and the perspective of later thinkers such as Craig Carter and Stephen Dempster who develop a strongly conservative theological and practical approach to the abortion issue. These men play a significant role in leading the Convention to publicly adopt a prolife orientation. The approach taken by these key leaders shows an affinity with the 1921 Social Gospel Platform's concern for the well-being of families, especially mothers and children. The resolutions passed by Convention Assembly point to a continuation of this tradition of concern, as does the ensuing interest in the development and support of the Crisis Pregnancy Centre ministries which begins to materialize in the late 1980s.","2000","2018-11-01 17:52:33","2018-11-01 17:52:33","2018-08-21 13:49:58","","125","","","","","“Conviction and compassion”","","","","","Acadia University (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/QPUGMBCR/MacKinnon - 2000 - “Conviction and compassion” Atlantic Baptists and.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rooted in the enthusiastic New Light religion of the First Great Awakening in Nova Scotia, this Christian spirituality was transferred to the Regular Baptist experience in the Maritimes during the first half of the nineteenth century. This transition was directed by a group of ""founders,"" later known as ""Fathers,"" of whom three--Harris Harding, Joseph Crandall, and Edward Manning--are examined in detail. The piety advocated and modeled by these ""Patriarchs""--which became known as the ""Faith of the Fathers""--was characterized by the revival, the New Birth and its ritualization in immersionist baptism. In spite of the denominational structures created around this collection of beliefs and practices, the ""Faith of the Fathers"" remained largely intact and continued to embody many characteristics of late eighteenth-century New Lightism. It fell to the second generation of Regular Baptist preachers to defend and advance this religious tradition in the post 1820 period. The piety and ministerial practice of Charles Tupper, Ingram Bill and Samuel Elder--all second generation preachers--during the 1820s, 1830s and 1840s reveal a remarkable continuity and faithfulness to the spirituality of the patriarchs. During the Maritime Baptismal controversy (1811-1848) a number of key second generation Regular Baptist preachers engaged in both ""popular"" and ""academic"" debate to defend immersionist baptism, their identity-giving ritual. Although many preachers became confident and polished denominational apologists during this period, the ""collective"" confidence and identity of the Maritime Regular Baptist community was shaken by the 1850s when the ""Fathers"" began to die in quick succession. This ""crisis"" was largely resolved by the mid-1850s as the denomination renewed its commitment to the ""Faith of Fathers"" and recognized within their tradition a wide-ranging and multi-faceted approach to piety and church life.","1997","2018-11-01 17:52:33","2018-11-01 17:52:33","2018-08-21 13:55:33","","389","","","","","""The faith of the fathers""","","","","","Queen's University (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/T6TQW73X/Goodwin - 1997 - The faith of the fathers Evangelical piety of M.pdf","","","Social sciences; nineteenth century","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is, therefore, not surprising that evangelical women build their personal identities based on their roles within the context of the Christian family and the church. After the death of their partner, elderly evangelical widows strengthen their sense of belonging to the faith community and still consider themselves to be part of a Christian family, even in the absence of their husband and children. This thesis examines the impact of religion on the experiences of widowhood through the lives of elderly United Baptist widows. While evangelical ideology plays an important role in women's adjustment to widowhood, variations in personal experience and declining health differentiate the ways in which elderly widows cope with their reality. Through the use of a focus group, 16 personal interviews, and observation of six religious activities and networks, this research examines the personal experiences of elderly evangelical widows as they cope with bereavement and loss and discover new realities in their life as a widow. Serving as the primary means of social interaction for many older widows, the faith community or church family provides widows with a full-time network of support and serves to maintain elderly widows' identities as nurturers and caregivers through fellowship with other believers. Its religious teachings and beliefs provide understanding of the past, through reaffirmation of the family; strength in the present, through understanding, acceptance and support; and hope for the future, through the promise of salvation and re-unification with family members who have died.","1998","2018-11-01 17:52:33","2018-11-01 17:52:33","2018-08-21 14:50:13","","170","","","","","""Blest be the tie that binds""","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/UTLA62BL/Hanson - 1998 - Blest be the tie that binds Examining the role .pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Each of the three sections contains two chapters. The first section, ""The Biblical and Theological Foundations for Church Planting,"" traces the central role of ""the people of God"" in God's plan of redemption. The organic nature of the church and the implications of the Great Commission indicate that God intends for the church to multiply itself among the peoples of the world. Biblical models and principles of church planting including the team approach and strategies of the Apostle Paul are provided. The second section, ""The Context for Church Planting,"" analyses the historical development and growth of the Convention together with a description of how changes in the philosophy of ministry of the Board have impacted its effectiveness in this task. An in-depth analysis of church planting methodologies and growth trends in churches planted in the last fifteen years provides the basis for the plan of ministry that is developed in the last section. The third section, ""The Strategy for Church Planting,"" includes a chapter on the selection and mentoring of church planters. A recruitment strategy and a structured interview is developed. A plan including new policies and practices will enable the Board to respond to inquiries from churches and Associations for assistance with church planting ministries. A specific strategy to initiate church planting in the urban Associations is developed. God designed the church to grow numerically, which includes the planting of new churches. A group of those churches have mandated the Home Mission Board to equip them for this task. This strategy has a firm biblical foundation while embracing the historic Baptist principle of the autonomy of the local church.","1993","2018-11-01 17:52:33","2018-11-01 17:52:33","2018-08-21 13:25:00","","259","","","","","","","","","","Fuller Theological Seminary, Doctor of Ministry Program","United States -- California","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","D.Min.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/GEKQDE8N/Gardner - 1993 - A Home Mission Board strategy for church planting .pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Baptist","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They also recognized Christ as head of both church and state, believed in supreme scriptural authority, and were distrustful of the Anglican Church and therefore critical of episcopacy. Reformed Presbyterian communities were founded in the Maritimes in the 1820's and 1830's. Other groups of Covenanter communities were founded slightly later in Upper Canada (Ontario) and Lower Canada (Quebec), and a group of congregations in western Canada was founded by Americans in the first two decades of the 20th century. In the Maritimes the movement lasted approximately one hundred years, and there are still four or five small congregations in the Ottawa Valley. James Reid Lawson (1820-91) came from Ireland in 1845 and was pastor in Southstream (later Barnesville), New Brunswick, until his death. Alexander Clarke (1794-1874) was the first Irish Reformed Presbyterian missionary to come to the Lower Provinces.

Mary Poulton Dawkins, an early benefactor of this church, who was born in England, was thought by many to have been the link in securing plans from London for the present building. More careful research reveals that the South Carolina building is virtually identical to St. Anne's Chapel at Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, designed by Frank Wills, an English architect from Exeter. Involved with the ""Oxford movement,"" which sought to bring about a renewal within the Church of England, Wills gave architectural expression to the movement's ideals. Wills later moved to New York to establish an architectural firm. The Reverend John DeWitt McCollough, who was known in South Carolina for the organization and construction of many church buildings during the 1840's-50's, knew of Wills's work in designing church buildings. Thus, it appears more probable that McCollough received the plans from Wills, instead of through Mary Dawkins.","1999-07","2018-11-01 17:52:07","2018-11-01 17:52:07","","241-254","","3","100","","South Carolina Historical Magazine","","","","","","","","","","","ahl","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","CHURCH buildings; ARCHITECTURE; DAWKINS, Mary Poulton, 1820-1906; McCollough, John DeWitt; South Carolina (Union); WILLS, Frank","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By reconstructing the experience and identity of this largely-misunderstood group, it sheds light on the relationship between church and empire, the role of religious pluralism and toleration in the American Revolution, the dynamics of loyalist politics, and the religious impact of the American Revolution on Britain. It is based primarily on the loyalist clergy’s own correspondence and writings, the records of the American Loyalist Claims Commission, and the archives of the SPG (the Church of England’s missionary arm). This dissertation focuses on the New England and Mid-Atlantic colonies, where Anglicans formed a religious minority and where their clergy were overwhelmingly loyalist. It begins with the founding of the SPG in 1701 and its first forays into America. It then examines the state of religious pluralism and toleration in New England, the polarising contest over the proposed creation of an American bishop after the Seven Years’ War, and the role of the loyalist clergy in the Revolutionary War itself, focusing particularly on conflicts occasioned by the Anglican liturgy and Book of Common Prayer. The dissertation proceeds to follow those loyalist clergy who left the Thirteen Colonies as refugees, tracing their reception in Britain, their influence on conservative churchmen there, and their role in rebuilding the imperial Church of England in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Particular attention is given to the relationship between the loyalist refugees, the English high church movement, and the Scottish Episcopal church. Bridging British, Canadian, and colonial American history, it suggests that the American Revolution galvanised an Anglican religious revival in the British Empire and shaped an emerging alliance between the Church of England and conservative politics. It ends in the 1790s, as this alliance solidified under the influence of the French Revolution. Most scholarship on religion and the American Revolution is ultimately concerned with the politics of the revolution. This dissertation, by contrast, asks how the politics of the revolution affected the religious lives of those who lived through it. It provides a sympathetic account of the loyalist clergy’s religious identities and beliefs, and situates them in the context of early-modern British religious history. In doing so, it reconstructs a distinct spiritual culture which was concerned with the holiness of suffering, persecution, and martyrdom. It locates the clergy’s loyalism in the longer history of political martyrdom, a category that has been overlooked by secular-minded historians of loyalism. The loyalist clergy were also preoccupied with the lack of state support for the colonial Church of England. Together with their allies and sympathizers in Britain, they formulated a powerful critique of the British Empire’s religious pluralism: an important but overlooked contribution to counter-enlightenment and counter-revolutionary thought in Britain. By studying that critique, this dissertation highlights the limits of state support for the colonial Church of England prior to the American Revolution, and identifies a turn towards greater state support in the wake of American independence.","2016","2018-11-01 17:52:07","2018-11-01 17:52:07","2018-08-21 13:58:41","","330","","","","","The Church Militant","","","","","Columbia University","United States -- New York","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/2SMGB4JJ/Walker - 2016 - The Church Militant The American Loyalist Clergy .pdf","","","Social sciences; Church of England; American Revolution; British Empire; Loyalism; Martyrdom; Refugees","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dispute in Burnt Church was sparked by the Marshall decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, which recognized the treaty rights of Mi'kmaq people to fish, and prompted the entry of Mi'kmaq fishers into the lobster fishery outside of the regulated season. Grounded in the academic study of religion, philosophical phenomenology, and ethnography, this study demonstrates that the “fishing dispute” in Burnt Church/Esgenoôpetitj was not simply a conflict over access to the lobster fishery, but a result of the deeply contested nature of this place. The dispute in Burnt Church is important as one illustration of the larger dilemma of place-based conflicts between indigenous and settler communities across Canada. Residents of the two communities of Burnt Church, Mi'kmaq and English, both argue that understanding the dispute requires understanding the place in which it occurred. The philosophical articulation of place suggests that place is the necessary ground of existence, and the way in which people and landscapes inscribe themselves on one another over time (Casey 1993, Malpas 1999, Stefanovic 2000). Religion and values shape sense of place in Burnt Church/Esgenoôpetitj both historically and culturally; further, people's senses of place are themselves profoundly religious, as sense of place binds together communal social identity. Exploration of this place-based understanding of the dispute, and its history, raises the importance of native and non-native rights, sovereignty, nationalism, and conservation as values articulated in the dispute, and socially and religiously negotiated during and after the conflict. The dissertation concludes with a brief examination of the importance of non-local senses of place in the dispute, such as those of the Canadian government and Canadian activists. Resolution of conflicts such as the dispute in Burnt Church/Esgenoôpetitj asks for more than simply negotiating the presenting issue, whether that issue is fishery access, forestry, or land rights; resolution requires attending to the implicit values and senses of place of both aboriginal people and settler communities.","2008","2018-11-01 17:53:00","2018-11-01 17:53:00","2018-08-21 13:01:22","","297","","","","","Contested place","","","","","University of Toronto (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/IEH3P43T/King - 2008 - Contested place  Religion and values in the dispu.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; New Brunswick; Burnt Church; Environmental conflict; Esgenoopetitj; Mi'kmaq; Religion; Values","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The estrangement of the region's aboriginal population from white arenas of social valuation provides a point of departure for this historical analysis of pre-Confederation Mi'kmaq-white relations; and the religious life of both peoples provides the raw material from which is constructed an understanding of both the evolution of alienated forms of existence in this context, and the possibility of freedom from these. With an initial assumption that religion is the mode by which human beings orient themselves in the world so as to ensure that their existence is meaningful, this analysis focuses on the human relationship with landscape in colonial Acadia. It is the fundamental need to feel 'at home' that is explored in respect to both aboriginal and white populations; and the religious symbols and myths that arise out of this necessity betray the emergence of two distinct forms of human alienation that of the Mi'kmaq from white colonial society, and that of whites from an authentic appreciation of the place in which they are situated. The dissertation concludes with suggestions for constructively utilizing knowledge of the religious structures that underpin the historical fact of New World alienation.","1994","2018-11-01 17:53:00","2018-11-01 17:53:00","2018-08-21 13:05:14","","209","","","","","No man's land","","","","","University of Ottawa (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/2ZY5VQLC/Reid - 1994 - No man's land British and Mi'kmaq in 18th and 19t.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; New Brunswick; Nova Scotia; nineteenth century; alienation; eighteenth century; landscape; Prince Edward Island; religion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This exploratory study uses Mills' analytic framework to examine critically this conventional wisdom in regard to the five Native Treatment Centres in New Brunswick. This study found large variations in the use of Native spirituality in the NTCs and community conflict over the use of Native spirituality in New Brunswick NTCs. The relevant literature supports Native Traditionalists' claim that the conflict over the use of Native spirituality in drug and alcohol treatment arises from the history of missionary condemnation of Native people's spiritual beliefs. This contention is confirmed in this study by counter-example: the NTC where Native spirituality is most used is the one where it has been endorsed by visiting and local Catholic clergy. Questions are raised for further study.","1997","2018-11-01 17:53:00","2018-11-01 17:53:00","2018-08-21 13:35:16","","127","","","","","The use of Native spirituality in addiction treatment","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/N3HUVT9U/Perley - 1997 - The use of Native spirituality in addiction treatm.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; Health and environmental sciences; Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Dawn wrote about collective racial uplift, Canada's black church, and about African Canadian ""firsts,"" whether in the fields of entertainment or nursing, in the Boy Scouts, or in the integration of segregated workplaces -- triumphs that Canada's white newspapers generally ignored. Challenging the notion that African Canadians did not have a black press comparable to the African American press in the United States, this article examines the editorial content, photographic journalism, and advertisements in The Dawn from its foundation to 1971, when it ceased publication. I argue that through its editorials, The Dawn played an instrumental role in cultivating a sense of community among blacks in Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes. This article also provides critiques of de facto Jim Crow laws in Canada, while highlighting the specific ways the black press combated pervasive racism with editorials about racial uplift, community advancement, civic engagement, and black entrepreneurship.

"N29M456C","thesis","2003","Helyar, Frances M.","A crisis in history education:  The life story of Myers's “General History” textbook in New Brunswick schools (1910–1949)","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/pqdtglobal/docview/305240981/abstract/ADF92AC5F8E24A03PQ/4","This thesis is a detailed archival study of a local crisis in history education. An examination of the politics and economics that informed the adoption (and subsequent rejection) of Myers's General History textbook, as used in New Brunswick Schools for much of the first half of the 20th century, allows a demonstration of the ongoing nature of what is perceived as a ‘crisis’ in history education. Education historian Ken Osborne identifies the 1920s as a time of concern about American content in Canadian schools. The Myers controversy began with the removal of the high school world history text from schools because the American author's new chapter about the Great War failed to mention Canada by name—and Canadians were (justifiably) angered by the snub. The course of the ten-year controversy reveals shifts in ideology and in what constitutes knowledge, and shows how politics, economics and religion, along with pedagogy, influence the textbook approval process. The tensions between public opinion (as expressed in editorials and letters to the editor) and bureaucratic expediency are played out in the slowly unfolding drama.","2003","2018-11-01 17:52:46","2018-11-01 17:52:46","2018-08-21 13:04:05","","192","","","","","A crisis in history education","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.Ed.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/DCPHST5E/Helyar - 2003 - A crisis in history education  The life story of .pdf","","","Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Letters sent to the government and newspapers demonstrate that pro-life and pro-choice activism escalated throughout the 1980s, forcing the government to take a stance in the debate. The abortion debate polarized New Brunswick citizens as they were forced to choose between protecting the life of the fetus or the woman's right to control her own body. While the government claimed to take a temperate position on the issue, the decrease in abortion services and the creation of an anti-abortion Bill indicated the strength of pro-life sentiments. Fundamentalist beliefs, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, were central to New Brunswick pro-life activism and were too powerful for the pro-choice movement to overcome.","2010","2018-11-01 17:52:46","2018-11-01 17:52:46","2018-08-21 13:26:02","","80","","","","","‘Not in the Atlantic Provinces’","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/FK67WKTS/Ackerman - 2010 - ‘Not in the Atlantic Provinces’ The Abortion Deba.pdf","","","Social sciences; New Brunswick","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies of religious ideology have been dominated by the 18th-century New Light movement and its Baptist legacy. Much of the recent work on popular tradition has focused on Newfoundland, especially Christmas mumming and the concept of the imagined community.

During a time of post war sensitivity to nationalism and patriotism, public feeling was aroused as the result of a complaint about Myers' General History, a world history textbook with a newly written chapter about the Great War. In the chapter, the American author made no reference to Canada, and overemphasized British and especially American war efforts. A close examination of events over the course of the following six months investigates the public outcry, the bureaucratic response of the New Brunswick Board of Education and the political manoeuvring of the media. Their focus on the original issues of patriotism, citizenship, history education and the role of schooling eventually dissolved into longstanding conflicts over language and religion. Contextualized in the rich historical literature examining history and citizenship education and the history of education in Canada, this dissertation draws on a wide range of archival sources, most particularly the Board of Education correspondence and New Brunswick newspapers, to explore how questions about history education were interpreted through the lens of the bureaucratic rationality of the educational administrator, the political partisanship of the newspaper editor, and the Acadian nationalism of the Roman Catholic Bishop. The 1920 New Brunswick history textbook controversy contributes to our understanding of the political nature of public memory, and the complex intertwining of religion and language rights within schooling, history education and citizenship in Canada, and in New Brunswick.","2010","2018-11-01 17:52:46","2018-11-01 17:52:46","2018-08-21 13:00:15","","251","","","","","Bureaucratic rationalism, political partisanship and Acadian nationalism","","","","","McGill University (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/MU6M59SN/Helyar - 2010 - Bureaucratic rationalism, political partisanship a.pdf","","","Social sciences; New Brunswick; Education; Acadian; Bureaucratic rationalism; History textbook; Partisanship","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies find that conservative Protestants, known for their literal interpretations of Biblical scripture, often believe that they are different from secular society in terms of lifestyle and leisure choices, as well as views on marriage and family life. Eager to ensure that their children adopt their chosen lifestyle, many parents maintain strict control, including the use of corporal punishment as part of their strategy of discipline. Parenting experts, such as James Dobson of Focus on the Family, have numerous resources for religious families that focus on wide-ranging marriage and childrearing advice. Based on 131 questionnaires and 51 in-depth interviews with conservative Protestant women in New Brunswick, Canada, the dissertation examines selected features of this religious subculture as it relates to family life. Considered in detail are variations in childrearing practices, perceptions about the role of mothering, and the influence of Christian and secular parenting experts on both ideas and practice. Results indicate that while conservative Protestants are often viewed as a homogenous group, their attitudes and experiences are divergent, in part a result of demographic and religious factors. Younger women are much more egalitarian in their parenting styles, mothers who have strong relationships outside of their church community are more likely to encourage assimilation of their children into the larger secular society, and women who have added family resources are more flexible in their childrearing decisions. While motherhood is highly valued within this religious community, many women continue to experience much frustration in their role as mothers, due in part to the perception that they have the more difficult parenting responsibilities. Instead of looking back on their childrearing years with fondness, the strict discipline they have employed with their children leave many women with feelings of regret. The results highlight the influence of both sacred and secular sources of assistance for religious women who struggle with parenting and other family issues.","2006","2018-11-01 17:52:46","2018-11-01 17:52:46","2018-08-21 13:09:35","","321","","","","","Religiosity, resources, and regrets","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/V32YFRW8/Ruff - 2006 - Religiosity, resources, and regrets  Religious an.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; Conservative Protestant; Mothering; Religiosity; Social variations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Founding parties were The Divinity Faculty of the University of King's College (Anglican Church of Canada), Holy Heart Theological Institute (The Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Halifax) and Pine Hill Divinity Hall (United Church of Canada). Its origins were part of a particular response to local, national and international conditions. In order to understand the origins of this institution and its uniqueness, it was necessary to examine early ecumenical endeavors in Halifax, including their societal roots and to trace the development of theological education in the three institutions including Holy Heart Seminary. It was also critical in understanding the origins of AST to examine the planning process for the school including both individual and institutional motivations. By 1970 each institution was experiencing varying crises. Holy Heart Seminary had closed, the Divinity Faculty of King's was experiencing a shortage of professors and students, and Pine Hill's Principal of twenty-five years was retiring. A group of individuals building on early ecumenical cooperation took a determined approach to these crises. Through planning, dialogue, deliberate action and compromise over an intensive six-month period, the Atlantic School of Theology came into existence consummating a history of challenge and adaptation to change as well as ecumenical cooperation in each of the three traditions.","1993","2018-11-01 17:52:46","2018-11-01 17:52:46","2018-08-21 14:36:42","","235","","","","","","","","","","Saint Mary's University (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/B5LYEC9A/Goodine - 1993 - Origins of Atlantic School of Theology.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Nova Scotia; Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The author traces American influences in the Church of England and in Baptist, Congregational, Methodist, and Presbyterian Churches. He concludes that American influences were generally received and absorbed without anti-American reactions in the Maritime colonies. In Upper Canada there was marked anti-Americanism, but this was largely a response to the War of 1812. Though Anglicans attacked the Methodists for pro-American political sympathies, their loyalty in the Rebellion of 1837 disproved the charge. In the last years prior to Confederation, Canadian Protestantism was able to accept or reject American ideas on merit without the old loyalty cry being raised. In the years 1837 to 1867 American influences were more in the realm of socioreligious thought than in that of church organization.

Loyalty oaths, or 'serments,' emerged in Europe to ensure the loyalty of subjects and soldiers who held greater fealty to their religion than their country and monarch. Oaths were sworn before God, in order that religious loyalty might trump itself. The allegiances of various populations in Atlantic Canada were a source of anxiety for the French and English. The first loyalty oaths were imposed on Acadians in 1654 by New Englanders who required them to never more bear arms against the English nation. French imperial powers also used 'serments,' and both sides tried them with aboriginal populations as well. Attitudes toward the oaths varied as Acadians were required to swear to one side after another. Refusals to swear fealty to the English crown resulted in the mass deportations of 1755.","2003-07","2018-11-01 17:52:46","2018-11-01 17:52:46","","31-48","","","4","","French Colonial History","","","","","","","","","","","ahl","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","CANADA; NOVA Scotia; ENGLAND; FRANCE; LOYALTY; OATHS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors first correlate the place of birth, ethnic origin, occupation, religion, and party affiliation of the provincial legislators with their position on confederation, and then examine four major areas of debate raised by the legislators. A remarkably uniform group of leaders gave most of their attention to questions of political structure, participation, distribution of powers, and the autonomy of the provinces, rather than to geopolitical differences, cultural tensions, or socioeconomic factors.","1990-05","2018-11-01 17:52:46","2018-11-01 17:52:46","","57-77","","1","5","","British Journal of Canadian Studies","","","","","","","","","","","ahl","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","CANADA; ATLANTIC Provinces; FEDERATIONS; LEGISLATORS; POLITICAL attitudes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During 1905-06, the United Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces formed from the union of the Maritime Convention of Maritime Baptists, the Free Baptists of New Brunswick, and the Free Baptists of Nova Scotia. Similarly in 1925, the United Church of Baptists of Nova Scotia formed, joining the United Church of Canada from the dominion's Congregationalists, Methodists, and two-thirds of its Presbyterians. The article compares and contrasts these formations, concluding the Regular (Calvinist) and Free (Arminian) Baptists of the Maritimes were able to unite largely because they were both formed in late-18th-century revival movements, retained a commitment to a believer's church, and practiced baptism by immersion. Also, the growth of capitalism and government had promoted a sense of free moral agency that weakened Calvinism. Regionalism also played a part in the rejection of union with the American Free Will Baptists in favor of union across theological lines within the Maritimes.","2004","2018-11-01 17:52:33","2018-11-01 17:52:33","","125-146","","2","41","","Journal of Ecumenical Studies","","","","","","","","","","","ahl","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","CANADA; MARITIME Provinces; BAPTISTS; CHRISTIAN union; ECUMENICAL movement; UNITED churches; UNITED churches & Christian union","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 1741, theological disputes among clergy resulted in formal splits among the New York, New Brunswick, and Philadelphia presbyteries. Three years later, a group of New England moderates who had worked for reunification united the New York Presbytery and the New Brunswick Presbytery in the Synod of New York and achieved a reunion with the Philadelphia Presbytery in 1741. The factions came together in the Synod of New York and Philadelphia in 1758. While the years of recruitment and charismatic revivalism known as the Great Awakening empowered the laity to influence the direction of the Presbyterian Church through support or condemnation of individual clergymen, the clergy regained control and temporarily stabilized the church through the establishment of the College of New Jersey, the calling of John Witherspoon to head the new college, and the reunification of the New York and the Philadelphia synods.","2000-01","2018-11-01 17:53:29","2018-11-01 17:53:29","","3-18","","1","78","","Journal of Presbyterian History","","","","","","","","","","","ahl","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","CLERGY; GREAT Awakening; PRESBYTERIAN Church; SCHISM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two key Reformed theologians, John Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli developed two distinct views of the Lord's Supper which are considered to be Reformed. Their distinctive theologies upon this subject are explored, compared and contrasted with one another as well as various competing theologies as found in Lutheranism and Roman Catholicism in order to highlight their similarities and differences with regards to the Supper. Also, it was crucial to study their theological position in light of the Reformed confessions which emerged both in their life time and in the decades following their deaths. The goal was to identify, if possible within the body of Reformed thought, a singular authoritative theological position on the Lord's Supper. This exploration concluded that Calvin's view of the Lord's Supper is predominating in the Reformed confessions examined. What is more, The Scot's Confession of 1560 is the most robust expression of Calvin's influence upon a nation which embraced the Reformed faith. The confession clearly holds forth that where the sacrament is rightly observed both the presence of Christ and his grace is made evident and bestowed upon his people. The thesis further submits that the evangelical Presbyterians of southwest Scotland came as close as possible to maintaining this unity in what became known as the 'sacramental seasons'. The spiritual formation of the people was always building toward a service of Word and Sacrament (for practical reasons they could not celebrate it weekly) for it was in these services the work of Christ within the body of Christ is most evident. This pattern of worship serves as a template for what should be normative in Christian worship. For many reformed pastors and theologians, beginning with John Nevin until today, there is a conviction that the service of Word and sacrament must be held as a unity. The benefits of this service will be a congregation which is more actively participating in their union with Jesus Christ as individuals and a body. The project aspect of this exploration into the Lord's Supper seeks to advance the corporate and individual spiritual formation of the communicants who attend Saint Matthew's. Communicants will be urged to actively commune with Christ and to integrate this experience with their fellow members at church, within homes and work will have a deeper sense of Christ working within them and their church. This will be accomplished through a weekly Preparatory Service, communion, home liturgy, and home visitation to communicants' unable to attend worship on Sunday. A test group working at The Saint John Regional Hospital will also participate in a chapel communion in an attempt to integrate Christ into their work routine as well. Evaluations of these ministries will be done through surveys and written and taped interviews with participating communicants.","2007","2018-11-01 17:53:29","2018-11-01 17:53:29","2018-08-21 13:27:27","","318","","","","","","","","","","Acadia University (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","D.Min.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/6F9QZBM9/Crawford - 2007 - The Lord's Supper and High Calvinism at Saint Matt.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; New Brunswick; High Calvinism; Lord's Supper; Presbyterian; Saint John; Saint Matthew's Presbyterian Kirk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ""Pentecostal tradition"" demonstrated a clear Pentecostal identity as early as the second generation of adherents. Institutionalization began in the 1930s and progressed rapidly over the next two decades. What originally had been a trans-denominational renewal movement soon became a collection of churches in its own right. The Pentecostals in the borderland region between the United States and Canada were inheritors of an experiential tradition that stretched back approximately 150 years. Simple, direct and immediate religion of the heart began with the Allinite tradition, the Free Christian Baptist tradition, the Primitive Baptist tradition, the Reformed Baptist tradition and lastly the Baptistic-Pentecostal tradition. Full Gospel-Pentecostalism illustrates the maturation process as it grew from a small local revival in northern Aroostook County, Maine to spread throughout northern New England and into the Maritime provinces. The variety of movements and the unique mix of both female and male leaders coalesced into a structured movement within thirty years. The result was the foundation of a vibrant Baptistic-Pentecostal presence in the region.","2005","2018-11-01 17:53:23","2018-11-01 17:53:23","2018-08-21 13:16:36","","127","","","","","From tent to tabernacle","","","","","Acadia University (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/W73XIG63/Flanagan - 2005 - From tent to tabernacle  A history of the origins.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A native of Dutchess County, New York, Losee supported the British during the American Revolution and went to Nova Scotia in 1783 as a United Empire Loyalist. While there he converted to Methodism. In 1789 the Methodist Episcopal Church sent him to the Lake Champlain circuit as a lay preacher. He soon crossed into Canada, however, and visited the Loyalist settlements along the St. Lawrence around Adolphustown, many of whose residents also came from Dutchess County. As a result he was allowed to form a circuit in Canada, and returned to the Adolphustown area in February 1791. Losee returned to New York after establishing Methodism in that area for four years. His departure was occasioned by a mental breakdown caused by his failure to win the hand of Elizabeth Detlor, who instead married Darius Dunham, Losee's assistant in Upper Canada.

The neglect of lay religion, however, has left this hypothesis untested. In the two decades following the first New Brunswick census of religion in 1861, Wesleyan Methodists remained the single largest religious group in the parish of St. Stephen. Yet the dynamics and demography of church growth show that low and fluid church involvement characterized both the rural settlements and expanding villages of this pre-industrial parish. By their remarkably varied and independent choices of religious affiliation, lay men and women determined the size and nature of Methodist communities and anticipated modern 'consumer religion'. Nevertheless, the content of their piety remained in essential continuity with the Methodist tradition. In fact, associational fluidity was rooted in the nature of Methodist belief, worship, and polity.

"TUT8NSHH","thesis","2004","Lane, Hannah M.","Methodist church members, lay leaders, and socio-economic position in mid-nineteenth century St. Stephen, New Brunswick","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/pqdtglobal/docview/305078147/abstract/47EF72FABB9E499APQ/2","In much of the historiography of Anglo-American Protestantism and class formation, evangelicals such as Methodists are cast in a key role, as actively constructing ""middling"" or ""middle class"" identity. This argument has linked Methodism to this identity chiefly through the interpretation of evangelicalism as a religious culture, rather than through the socio-economic positions of Methodists themselves. This dissertation explores the extent to which Methodists in the parish of St. Stephen, New Brunswick, were associated with any one socio-economic position. It examines the relationship between gender and Methodist piety, the economic practices of local churches, and patterns of church involvement among different socio-economic groups. This community study draws on both qualitative and quantitative sources, profiling 2,580 Methodist church members, lay leaders, or adherents. Neither Methodist church members nor adherents in St. Stephen were demographically and socially homogenous groups. Although most lay leaders were relatively prosperous men, some were not, and some leaders were women. Most church members were women who joined at all stages of the life course; only a minority were men, primarily older and married men. The poor were neither over nor underrepresented, and church members reflected the socio-economic composition of local Protestants as a whole. In contrast to the founders of a socially homogenous Congregationalist church which emerged out of a Methodist schism, Methodist lay leaders, church members, and adherents still fit the model of the socially diverse church.","2004","2018-11-01 17:53:16","2018-11-01 17:53:16","2018-08-21 13:12:50","","421","","","","","","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Canada","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/jsanford/Zotero/storage/G6DLY95I/Lane - 2004 - Methodist church members, lay leaders, and socio-e.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; New Brunswick; Church members; Lay leaders; Methodist; Socioeconomic position; St. Stephen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
