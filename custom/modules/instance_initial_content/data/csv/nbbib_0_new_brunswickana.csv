"U2SUS898","thesis","2005","Sable, Trudy; University of New Brunswick; Faculty of Education","Emerging identities: a proposed model for an interactive science curriculum for first nations students","","","","","","Mi'kmaw students face a complexity of personal, cultural, and social conditions within contemporary educational systems that affect their continued participation in the educational process offered within Atlantic Canada. Despite a variety of approaches developed by educators to address the high drop out rate and lack of interest in science, the statistics remain largely unchanged. Aboriginal educators are calling for a ""new story"" in education that better meets the needs of Aboriginal students. This study attempts to identify the conditions and contexts necessary to bridge the gap that currently exists for Aboriginal students in science studies. The research investigates the basic relationship between learning in general and the meaning-making processes engaged in by students of a Grade 7/8 class within a Mi'kmaw reserve school. It leads to a proposal for an alternative pedagogy, or a new narrative, for teaching science to Aboriginal students and the foundations for a culturally interactive science curriculum. For educators to understand the complexity of issues affecting Mi'kmaw student achievement in science requires a theoretical framework that allows the students' lived experience to emerge. Toward this end, the research includes both phenomenological and ethnographic approaches to understanding the lived experiences and cultural narratives based on interviews with the students, a field trip within the community, and a trial chemistry lesson. I examined how these students perceive themselves in different contexts and how their sense of identity establishes the meaningfulness of particular educational content. I also assessed how person, community/cultural and social contexts affect the students' learning. Part of creating this new narrative requires recognizing knowledge, including science, as a cultural product Taking this cultural view of scientific knowledge allows us to view learning as a process of identity formation and culture as a system of symbols including language itself This identity is based on personal, cultural, historical and social factors that come to bear on each student's definition of who they are and what knowledge is pertinent to survival and well being. Five fundamental themes emerged from the interviews and field trips--fragile ontologies, multiple layers of identity (personal, cultural, pan-tribal, and societal), border crossings, the continuing and emerging aspects of culture, and beyond borders to a spiritual narrative--and became the foundation for a culturally interactive science education model of learning. The model assists educators through a visualization of layers of identity, porous borders and seeming paradoxes, and ""narrative unity"" beyond boundaries--all of which affect the learning of science. The content of a culturally interactive curriculum is drawn from the cultural heritage of the students, giving them an historical context with which to identify. Working with Mi'kmaw language and notational representation is shown to assist educators in cultural border crossing and creating cultural continuity for the students. Taken into the classroom, this interactive paradigm could be adapted to pedagogical methods as ""speaking together"" times, in which students explore the processes of doing science while appreciating their own cultural traditions. In so doing, educators can come to know the larger narrative that gives shape to student's identities and ways of relating to the world. Then it becomes possible for educators to recognize the boundaries that obstruct or open a path to meaningful learning experiences.","2005","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","","","","","","Emerging identities","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 270500037","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Straddling the continent for more than a century and globe for more than fifty years, Canadian Pacific is inextricably linked with the history of Canada itself. In 1885, the company completed the construction of two thousand miles of railway system and linking the Atlantic to the Pacific. It then established fleets of vessels on both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, laying the foundation for a transportation route that allowed members of the British Empire to travel around the world. To enhance the travel experience, the company also constructed great castle-like hotels, including the Algonquin in St. Andrews, the Chateau Frontenac in Quebec City, and the Banff Springs Hotel in the Rockies, which themselves became landmarks. In this sumptuously illustrated history of a company whose story is integral to the Golden Age of Travel, Barry Lane recounts the history of Canadian Pacific, from the construction of the transcontinental railway to the development of the hotels and the building of the shipping line that linked Canada to the rest of the world.""--From publisher","2015","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","199","","","","","Canadian Pacific","","","","","Goose Lane","Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada","","","","","","catalog.loc.gov Library Catalog","HE2810.C2 L288 2015","OCLC: ocn907659156","","","","","History; Railroads; Canada; Canadian Pacific Railway Company; Pictorial works","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It encompasses short biographical sketches and tells the stories of naturalists and botanists in the light of the times in which they lived. The account illustrates the development of the science of botany and shows how, as museums and learning centres were established in the new land, North Americans became masters in their own house, taking over the botanical enquiry that had previously been the prerogative of Europeans. It examines early ecological studies and curious anomalies of plant distribution, as well as the modern-day emphasis on plant diversity and the need for conservation. It embodies implicit lessons that speak to our present-day concerns with climate change and the environment. Finally, it claims a place for early UNB botanists and for New Brunswick in botanical and environmental historiography.","2015","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2017-03-15 19:07:28","","","","","","","Nature's bounty","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 907937406","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Jarvis had studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in the 1920s, later becoming part of the social realist movement, committed to an art ""of the people."" In 1941 Jarvis co-founded the UNB Art Centre with Pegi Nicol MacLeod, and together they turned it into a place of creative effervescence. Passionate and single-minded, Jarvis threw herself into everything that she did and the results were nothing short of astounding. In a few short years, she and MacLeod had transformed their environment. Yet it wasn't until the early 1960s that the unstoppable Jarvis set out on her own. She left the art centre and headed for Paris. In four extended stays during the 1960s, she immersed herself completely, living in French, attending the open studios, and connecting with other artists. Her retreats to Pembroke Dyke near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, during the summer months allowed her to digest her experiences, and her art took on new life. The influences of both impressionism and post-impressionism emerged in her work, and her paintings became more boldly colourful, freer--more completely her own. Lucy Jarvis: Even Stones Have Life is the first examination of Jarvis's considerable body of work--what she painted, how she rendered it, and how her art permeated her life and her life permeated her art.""--","2016","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","","","","","","Lucy Jarvis","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 921865590","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"KG3VSRKV","journalArticle","1992","Anonymous","Ric Cummings: Publishing the Province","The Brunswick Business Journal","","0829-5239","","","FREDERICTON--There are a lot of stories about Ric Cummings on the streets of Fredericton. And not much wonder. Because of his ""what will be, will be"" attitude and rapid-fire, Groucho Marx-like sense of humor, the 39-year old publisher always leaves a lasting impression. Those who know him well say his sense of humor is an important ingredient in his recipe for success in one of the most difficult and challenging sectors of the Canadian economy: book publishing. ""I love this business,"" says Cummings with a broad smile. ""It's interesting, I get to meet a lot of people and I've learned a tremendous amount about New Brunswick. And I'm always learning something new...especially when the bank calls.""

An Irish journeyman seeks riches enough to end his desperation; his search will lead him into the shadows ... Four seekers of wealth are drawn into a frantic contest against each other; their quest will end in misery ... These and many more will enter the foreboding wilds of French Fort Cove and never leave the same again. Brave the darkness, test your courage and journey with them, golden treasures may be the least of what you find. Often considered a place of tranquility and solitude, you'll soon see that the cove's outer beauty masks the despair and desolation of centuries and the pain and heartache of so many. Don't worry if you find yourself cheering on the worst reprobates, feeling sympathy for the vilest monsters and laughing alongside those who hold life at no cost.

Rethinking Professionalism challenges this narrative by questioning the assumptions that underlie the category of artistic professionalism, a construct as influential for artistic practice as it has been for art historical understanding. Through a series of in-depth studies, contributors examine changes to the infrastructure of the art world that resulted from a powerful discourse of professionalization that emerged in the late- nineteenth century. While many women embraced this new model, others fell by the wayside, barred from professional status by virtue of their class, their ethnicity, or the very nature of the artworks they produced. The richly illustrated essays in this collection depict the changing nature of the professional paradigm as it was experienced by women painters, photographers, craftspeople, architects, curators, gallery directors, and art teachers. In so doing, they demonstrate the ongoing power of feminist art history to disrupt patterns of thought that have become naturalized and, accordingly, invisible.""--Pub. desc.","2012","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","","","","","","Rethinking professionalism","","","","","McGill-Queen's University Press","Montréal","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 761459483","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"3YMTWE6C","book","2013","McTavish, Lianne","Defining the modern museum: a case study of the challenges of exchange","","978-1-4426-4443-4","","","","Defining the Modern Museum is a fascinating exploration of the museum as a cultural institution. Emphasizing museums' relationship to schools, libraries, and government agencies, this interdisciplinary study challenges long-standing assumptions about museums - revealing their messy, uncertain origins, and belying the standard narrative of their educational purpose having been corrupted by corporate goals. Using theoretical models and extensive archival research, Lianne McTavish examines the case of Canada's oldest continuing public museum, the New Brunswick Museum in Saint John. Focusing on the period between 1842 and the 1950's, McTavish addresses topics such as the transnational exchange of objects between museums, efforts by women to claim space within the organization, the creation of Carnegie libraries, and the rising status of curators. Shedding light on many topics of current interest, especially the commodification and globalization of museums, this study makes a lively contribution to museum studies and cultural studies.","2013","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","","","","","","Defining the modern museum","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 812064500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It seems a long time since we last ran into each other! I am addressing this query to you as you will certainly know the best person to direct it to within PANB.    I am conducting some research on NB bibliography and am looking for the business records of the three main NB English-language publishers of the 19th Century : J & A McMillan, Henry Chubb and Barnes & Co.  I am wondering if the PANB may have some or all of these.  As these printer/publishers were all in St. John, I have thought of contacting the NBM.  However, I thought I should start with you first.    Thank you in advance for any help you can give me.  I look forward to hearing from you.

"W68TE6JR","book","2011","Blades, Joe","Liszt listening lists: (a symphonic poem performance) after Peter Allen performing Franz Liszt","","978-1-55391-110-4","","","","""2011 marks Hungarian pianist-composer Franz Liszt's bicentenary. Among other things, he composed orchestral music he called 'symphonic poems' that interpreted poems, paintings or other non-musical sources. 'As a twist on this idea, the Charlotte Street Arts Centre will host visual artists and writers to interpret, during the concert, the musical works presented' (from the Program). Joe Blades was one of three Fredericton artists invited to create during Peter Allen's recital on 19 October 2011. Blades chose to mostly write poetry in response to the actions and environment felt in Liszt's music in Peter Allen's powerful performance. During 'Sonata in B minor' Blades weaves the music-in[s]pired poetry with images from his experiences in Central Europe and, especially, in Budapest, Hungary. During the next two days Blades produced a near-instant chapbook of his 'symphonic poem'. The typeset poem overprinted on images of the poems original handwritten journal pages make for a visually rich presentation.""--Pub.","2011","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","","","","","","Liszt listening lists","","","","","Broken Jaw Press","Fredericton, NB","English","","","","SPECAR","Open WorldCat","","","","","","HIL-SPECAR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But in December 1941, the Empire of Japan invades the colony. The family is quickly dragged into a spiral of violence, repression, and starvation. To survive, they entomb themselves and their friends in the Leung mansion. But this is only a temporary reprieve, and the Leungs are forced to send their children away. The youngest boy, Chung-Man, escapes with some of his siblings, and together they travel deep into the countryside to avoid the Japanese invaders. Thrown into a new world, Chung-Man befriends a young couple who yearn to break free of their rural life. But their friendship ends when the Japanese arrive, and Chung-Man is once again taken captive. Unwittingly and unwillingly, he enters a new cycle of violence and punishment until he finally breaks free from his captors and returns to Hong Kong. Deeply scarred, Chung-Man drifts along respectfully and dutifully, enveloped by the unspoken vestiges of war. It is only as he leaves home once again - this time for university in America - that he finally glimpses a way to keep living with his troubled and divided self. Written in restrained, yet beautiful and affecting prose, The Water Beetles is an engrossing story of adventure and survival. Based loosely on the diaries and stories of the author's father, this mesmerizing story captures the horror of war through the eyes of a child with unsettling and unerring grace.""--","2017","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","355","","","","","The water beetles","","","","","Goose Lane Editions","Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada","","","","","","catalog.loc.gov Library Catalog","PR9199.4.K23 W38 2017","OCLC: ocn957505655","","","","","Combat Disorders; Hong Kong; Japan; World War II; World War, 1939-1945","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

""In this volume, Leroux also documents more adventurous takes on modern space and aesthetics, found particularly in churches constructed from the late 1940s to early 1970s and in the expressive spaces of the Modern Movement. He observes that structures such as the initial Universite de Moncton buildings, the Hugh John Flemming Bridge in Hartland, and the Centennial Building in Fredericton will be increasingly valued as central to New Brunswick's heritage. By the late twentieth century, the province began to witness surprising interpretations of Postmodernist, Neotraditionalist, Contemporary and Green architecture, marking a renewed enthusiasm for celebrating form.""--Jacket.","2008","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","310","","","","","Building New Brunswick","","","","","Goose Lane","Fredericton, N.B.","English","","","","SPECAR","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 191889818","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authorities suspected foul play, but the identities of the victims were as mysterious as that of the perpetrator. From the twists and turns of a coroner's inquest, an unlikely suspect emerged to stand trial for murder: John Munroe, a renowned architect, well-heeled family man, and pillar of the community. Munroe was arguably the first in Canada's fledgling judicial system to actively defend himself. His lawyer's strategy was as simple as it was revolutionary: Munroe's wealth, education, and exemplary character made him incapable of murder. The press and Saint John's elite vocally supported Munroe, sparking a debate about character and murder that continues to this day. In re-examining a precedent-setting historical crime with fresh eyes, Komar addresses questions that still echo through the halls of justice more than a century later: is everyone capable of murder, and should character be treated as evidence in homicide trials?""--","2016","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","","","","","","Black River Road","","","","","","","Text in English.","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 946215690","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

'A Full House and Fine Singing' features a selection of Sadie Harper Allen's liveliest diary entries and most colourful letters, chosen by social historian Mary Biggar Peck. Illustrated with photographs and drawings, including some of Sadie's own, this book offers an authentic glimpse into the life of a young woman in turn-of-the-century Canada. In the 1890s, a girl in a small Canadian town like Shediac, New Brunswick, didn't have much to do - except tease boys, learn to draw and paint, go visiting on the train, and spend hilarious evenings playing parlour games and singing around the piano. Throughout her teenage years, Sadie Harper kept a diary, faithfully or fitfully, depending on her physical and romantic health of her household duties. As a young woman, she wrote of her experiences at Mount Allison Ladies' College. Many years later, on a trip to England with her husband, University of Manitoba professor Frank Allen, Sadie regaled her mother and sisters with news of social engagements, London fashions and the people she encountered.""--Www.doullbooks.com.","1992","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","","","","","","A full house and fine singing","","","","","Goose Lane","Fredericton, N.B.","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 26933373","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"YGHVXFVK","book","2011","Poitras, Jacques","Imaginary line: life on an unfinished border","","978-0-86492-650-0","","","","At one time a single settlement shared both sides of the Saint John River, until a political trade-off split it down the middle. From that inauspicious start, the Maine-New Brunswick border, the first boundary to be drawn between Canada and the U.S., has served as a microcosm for relations between the two nations. For centuries, friends, lovers, schemers, and smugglers have reached across the line. Now, post 9/11, political paranoia has led to a sharp divide, disrupting the lives of residents caught in the middle of world events. An elderly Canadian couple's driveway touches the border, leading to a Kafkaesque overreaction by Homeland Security. The Tea Party calls for complete border shutdown. Once friendly neighbours have become increasingly isolated from each other. In this timely exploration, Jacques Poitras travels the length of the border-from Madawaska and Aroostook counties through Passamaquoddy Bay to a tiny island still in dispute-to uncover an arbitrary line that shouldn't be there, almost wasn't there, and can be difficult to find even when it is there. The stakes are high as New Brunswick and Maine re-imagine their relationship for the 21st century.","2011","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","","","","","","Imaginary line","","","","","Goose Lane Editions","Frederiction, N.B.","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 727455295","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

His relationship with the upland marsh above the Cumberland Basin was a a particularly fruitful one from a literary standpoint, and poetry collections such as 'High Marsh Road' and 'Dykelands' secure Lochhead a place alongside Charles G.D. Roberts and John Thompson in the fraternity of Tantramar bards. Among the most iconic modern-day elements of the Tantramar's landscape are the towers which comprise Radio Canada International's transmission site, which since 1943 have broadcast Canadian shortwave radio signals around the world. In June 2012, RCI will discontinue shortwave broadcasting due to changing technology and federal funding cutbacks. This keepsake was produced by Thaddeus Holownia and Andrew Steeves in tribute to the passing of these two Sackville institutions and 'homesick noise' they sent 'around the world from this brooding marsh.'""

Holownia and Thurston have over the past several years explored, through the complimentary media of photography and literary prose, the intersection of the cultural and natural history of Salmo salar - a task these two Maritime artists are uniquely qualified to undertake ... Thaddeus Holownia has travelled to the many salmon rivers of eastern Canada, in all seasons, to capture their essential qualities. Employing his signature, large-format 7 x 17"" view camera, his images memorialize and celebrate the riparian habitat of the Atlantic salmon: its geology, forests, pools and runs, as well as its cultural artifacts. Among the rivers being featured are the Pinware in Labrador, Humber in Newfoundland, the Margaree in Cape Breton, the Miramichi, Upsalquich and Restigouche in New Brunswick, River Philip in Nova Scotia, the Grand Cascapedia in Gaspe, and the Penobscot in Maine.

A chance discovery of Saturday morning art classes at the Art Gallery of Toronto, organized by Arthur Lismer, changed the direction of his life. Today, Bruno Bobak's paintings, drawings, and prints hang in major collections in Canada, the United States, the UK, Poland, and Scandinavia."" ""During the Second World War, Bruno Bobak became Canada's youngest Official War Artist. It was also during the War that he met Molly Lamb, whom he later married and with whom he relocated first to Ottawa and later to Galiano Island and Vancouver. In 1947, he became head of the design department at the Vancouver School of Art (now the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design) and began showing his work in national and international exhibitions. In 1960, he was appointed Artist-in-Residence for a one-year term at the University of New Brunswick. In 1962, he returned to Fredericton as director of the University of New Brunswick Art Centre."" ""Bruno Bobak is best known for his tender yet aggressive figurative paintings. Large in scale, Expressionistic in style, and vigorous and surprising in colour, they show profound sympathy for the human condition mingled with shrewd recognition of human frailty. His use of bold angular lines, impastoed application of paint, and grand gestures are memorable attributes of his major work."" ""This sweeping look at the life and work of an illustrious artist approaches Bobak's art from the point of view of six artists, curators, and colleagues: Hermenegilde Chiasson, the multi-talented artist who is also Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick; Herb Curtis, a novelist, essayist, and fishing companion; Laura Brandon, curator of War Art at the Canadian War Museum; the internationally renowned Vancouver painter, printmaker, and educator Gordon Smith; Marjory Rogers Donaldson, a painter, portraitist, and colleague; and critic and curator Roslyn Rosenfeld. Combining distinctive, thought-provoking texts with more than 95 reproductions of his paintings, drawings, and prints.""--Jacket.","2006","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","","","","","","Bruno Bobak","","","","","Goose Lane Editions","Frederick, N.B.","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 71003162","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Jarvis had studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in the 1920s, later becoming part of the social realist movement, committed to an art ""of the people."" In 1941 Jarvis co-founded the UNB Art Centre with Pegi Nicol MacLeod, and together they turned it into a place of creative effervescence. Passionate and single-minded, Jarvis threw herself into everything that she did and the results were nothing short of astounding. In a few short years, she and MacLeod had transformed their environment. Yet it wasn't until the early 1960s that the unstoppable Jarvis set out on her own. She left the art centre and headed for Paris. In four extended stays during the 1960s, she immersed herself completely, living in French, attending the open studios, and connecting with other artists. Her retreats to Pembroke Dyke near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, during the summer months allowed her to digest her experiences, and her art took on new life. The influences of both impressionism and post-impressionism emerged in her work, and her paintings became more boldly colourful, freer--more completely her own. Lucy Jarvis: Even Stones Have Life is the first examination of Jarvis's considerable body of work--what she painted, how she rendered it, and how her art permeated her life and her life permeated her art.""--","2016","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","","","","","","Lucy Jarvis","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 921865590","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, rural communities have made an important and lasting contribution to New Brunswick's sports heritage, and none more so than the international border town of St. Stephen situated on the St. Croix River, across from Calais, Maine USA. In sport as in life, each generation inspires the next, and even today those who 'play sports' in St. Stephen hold a special place in the hearts and minds of those who live and work there. 'Hometown Sports Heroes' highlights the remarkable achievements of these athletes, teams and sport builders who have been an integral part of community life in St. Stephen from the early 1900's to the present day.""--Container.","2004","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 944442311","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Today their descendants are scattered around the world, perhaps unaware of their Yorkshire roots. This video celebrates what has become for many, the forgotten migration. Our story is told through the voices of those emigrants' descendants. Viewers will journey with them to many of the Yorkshire sites on the Tantramar. Visit the exact spot where the first schooner landed at Fort Cumberland on May 21st, 1772. Join Yorkshire descendants as they search through marsh grasses on a windy hill near Fort Beauséjour for their ancestor's final resting place. Tour the fort and learn about the Eddy Rebellion. Meet members of the Danks Rangers, historical re-enactors camping at Keillor House in Dorchester. Visit Chapman House and the Point de Bute Methodist burial grounds. Learn about the roots of the Methodism in North America and the beginning of Mount Allison University. Travel to River Philip and Oxford, Nova Scotia. Roam the Tantramar with its Yorkshire barns and visit what was once a thriving harbour and shipyard, now reduced to dry marshland. This video explores the immigration and settlement of these families, but, most of all, it celebrates their rich Yorkshire heritage and their many achievements.","2000","2019-02-25 20:34:01","2019-02-25 20:34:01","","","","","","","","Yorkshire 2000","","","","","Midwood Media","Grand Bay, N.B.","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 71766905","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drs. Spray and Rhinelander paint a nuanced historical picture of St. Thomas's evolution from a small Roman Catholic college founded in 1860 on the Miramichi to the nationally recognized liberal arts university it had become by 1990 and remains today.
