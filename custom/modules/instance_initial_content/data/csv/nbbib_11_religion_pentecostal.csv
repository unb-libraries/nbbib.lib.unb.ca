The ""Pentecostal tradition"" demonstrated a clear Pentecostal identity as early as the second generation of adherents. Institutionalization began in the 1930s and progressed rapidly over the next two decades. What originally had been a trans-denominational renewal movement soon became a collection of churches in its own right. The Pentecostals in the borderland region between the United States and Canada were inheritors of an experiential tradition that stretched back approximately 150 years. Simple, direct and immediate religion of the heart began with the Allinite tradition, the Free Christian Baptist tradition, the Primitive Baptist tradition, the Reformed Baptist tradition and lastly the Baptistic-Pentecostal tradition. Full Gospel-Pentecostalism illustrates the maturation process as it grew from a small local revival in northern Aroostook County, Maine to spread throughout northern New England and into the Maritime provinces. The variety of movements and the unique mix of both female and male leaders coalesced into a structured movement within thirty years. The result was the foundation of a vibrant Baptistic-Pentecostal presence in the region.","2005","2022-01-19 18:33:54","2022-01-19 18:33:54","","","127","","","","","From Tent to Tabernacle","","","","","Acadia University","Wolfville, NS","English","","M.A.","UNBF","","","","","","/home/cvillami/Zotero/storage/3VUTJY9E/Flanagan - 2005 - From tent to tabernacle  A history of the origins.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
