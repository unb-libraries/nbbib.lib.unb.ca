The author traces the emergence of presbyteries and synods and considers the divisions in 19th-century Presbyterianism resulting from differing attitudes with respect to church and state relations. After treating the merger of various Presbyterian bodies in 1875, the author considers the disruption of 1925 when the majority of Presbyterians entered the United Church of Canada, but a minority formed a continuing Presbyterian church. He concludes with observations respecting the subsequent history of both bodies.

Two key Reformed theologians, John Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli developed two distinct views of the Lord's Supper which are considered to be Reformed. Their distinctive theologies upon this subject are explored, compared and contrasted with one another as well as various competing theologies as found in Lutheranism and Roman Catholicism in order to highlight their similarities and differences with regards to the Supper. Also, it was crucial to study their theological position in light of the Reformed confessions which emerged both in their life time and in the decades following their deaths. The goal was to identify, if possible within the body of Reformed thought, a singular authoritative theological position on the Lord's Supper. This exploration concluded that Calvin's view of the Lord's Supper is predominating in the Reformed confessions examined. What is more, The Scot's Confession of 1560 is the most robust expression of Calvin's influence upon a nation which embraced the Reformed faith. The confession clearly holds forth that where the sacrament is rightly observed both the presence of Christ and his grace is made evident and bestowed upon his people. The thesis further submits that the evangelical Presbyterians of southwest Scotland came as close as possible to maintaining this unity in what became known as the 'sacramental seasons'. The spiritual formation of the people was always building toward a service of Word and Sacrament (for practical reasons they could not celebrate it weekly) for it was in these services the work of Christ within the body of Christ is most evident. This pattern of worship serves as a template for what should be normative in Christian worship. For many reformed pastors and theologians, beginning with John Nevin until today, there is a conviction that the service of Word and sacrament must be held as a unity. The benefits of this service will be a congregation which is more actively participating in their union with Jesus Christ as individuals and a body. The project aspect of this exploration into the Lord's Supper seeks to advance the corporate and individual spiritual formation of the communicants who attend Saint Matthew's. Communicants will be urged to actively commune with Christ and to integrate this experience with their fellow members at church, within homes and work will have a deeper sense of Christ working within them and their church. This will be accomplished through a weekly Preparatory Service, communion, home liturgy, and home visitation to communicants' unable to attend worship on Sunday. A test group working at The Saint John Regional Hospital will also participate in a chapel communion in an attempt to integrate Christ into their work routine as well. Evaluations of these ministries will be done through surveys and written and taped interviews with participating communicants.","2007","2022-01-19 18:33:59","2022-01-19 18:33:59","","","318","","","","","","","","","","Acadia University","Wolfville, NS","English","","D.Min.","Acadia","","","","","","/home/cvillami/Zotero/storage/BB6D578J/Crawford - 2007 - The Lord's Supper and High Calvinism at Saint Matt.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; High Calvinism; Lord's Supper; New Brunswick; Presbyterian; Saint John; Saint Matthew's Presbyterian Kirk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
