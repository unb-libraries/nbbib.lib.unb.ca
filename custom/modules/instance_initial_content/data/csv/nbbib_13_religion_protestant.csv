"6DTNWUNB","thesis","2008","Nelson, Shelley F.","Links in the Chain Maritime Women and the Protestant Missionary Movement, 1870–1925","","","","","https://login.proxy.hil.unb.ca/login?url=https://www-proquest-com.proxy.hil.unb.ca/docview/1027215956?accountid=14611","Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the experience of women in Western society, particularly that of middle-class women, was shaped by the tenets of a domestic ideology that stressed the notion of public and private spheres. This study moves beyond an examination of the ""separate sphere"" inhabited by Maritime women and, instead, focuses on the ways that women's roles in Maritime society were negotiated and renegotiated in the interstices where change occurs; the mission fields of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries provided one of those spaces. By examining the religious literature of the day, personal papers, letters and diaries, articles in Church journals and magazines – particularly those written by women for women – and the official papers of various mission organizations, this dissertation explains how Maritime women, both at home and abroad, entered a larger, public sphere far removed from the private domains assigned to them by an all-encompassing domestic ideology that stressed women's particular role as wife and mother, exemplar and protector of Western mores and civilization. Even though Maritime women did not openly challenge the subordinate role assigned to them by both the church and separate spheres ideology, changes in their interpretation and adaptation of separate spheres doctrine can be traced through an examination of their participation in, and support for, the foreign mission cause during the period from 1870-1925. The 84 women missionaries whose experiences are at the core of this dissertation, all of whom were participants in the Protestant foreign missionary movement from 1870-1925, did not change the patriarchal nature of mission work. Yet, their participation in the foreign missionary movement, combined with the activism of their mission supporters at home, did allow middle-class Maritime women to redefine their role in a public sphere without renouncing the private sphere assigned to them. Their belief in a mandate that stressed ""women's work for women"" allowed them not only to participate in missions but also to influence the very direction of the mission movement. Their efforts and experiences present an excellent case study for feminist historians interested in the ways in which women tend to choose to work within, rather than confront, ideologies which would limit and constrain their activities to acceptable spheres – a problem which continues to challenge women today.","2008","2022-01-19 18:34:12","2022-01-19 18:34:12","","","391","","","","","","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Fredericton, NB","English","","Ph.D.","UNBF","","","","","","/home/cvillami/Zotero/storage/Y7UYV46K/Nelson - 2008 - Links in the chain maritime women and the Protesta.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; Maritime; Missionary movement; Protestant; Women missionaries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"P759V7QE","thesis","1993","Williams, Robert J. M.","Narratives of Protestant Mission in Canada: The Writings of Benjamin Kohlmeister, Joshua Marsden, and Joseph Abbott, 1814-1846","","","","","","The critical study of colonial literature in Canada has focussed largely on the writings of explorers, soldiers, scientific travellers, tourists, land speculators, emigrant settlers, and even artists. Comparatively little study, however, has been devoted to another Canadian traveller and writer of the period: the missionary. This thesis surveys the literary history of the Protestant missionary in Canada and examines in detail three individual texts representative of the genre of missionary writing in an attempt to describe and assess its discursive characteristics and to establish the place of the Protestant missionary writer on the Canadian literary continuum. Chapter One establishes the importance of missionary and missionary-inspired literature to the development of the Canadian literary and cultural imagination. Chapter Two introduces the reader to the history of Protestant missionary literature in Canada by exploring the three missionary societies which did the most to produce and promote it: the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the Methodist Missionary Society, and the United Brethren Society for the Furtherance of the Gospel among the Heathen. Chapters Three, Four and Five offer readings of individual missionary texts: Benjamin Kohlmeister's and George Kmoch's Journal of a Voyage from Okkak, on the Coast of Labrador, to Ungava Bay (1814), Joshua Marsden's Narrative of a Mission to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the Somers Islands (1816), and Joseph Abbott's Philip Musgrave; or, the Memoirs of a Church of England Missionary in the North American colonies. (1846). The discussion of each of these texts is devoted to an introduction, biographical sketch of the author, literary and publication details, critical analysis, and conclusion. Critical readings focus on narrative strategies and methods by which the author's experience of the Canadian landscape, and its inhabitants and their manners and customs is communicated to the reader.","1993","2022-01-19 18:34:12","2022-01-19 18:34:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Edinburgh (United Kingdom)","Scotland","English","","Ph.D.","British Library","","","","","","","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; (UMI)AAIU057850","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study utilized techniques of thematic analysis taken from the toolkit of grounded theory to elucidate the perspectives and experiences of the eighteen clergy women who participated in face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Several themes reflecting the activities and strategies that the clergy women undertook to support and protect women who are victims of abuse emerged from the participant's responses. Key themes included the perception of gender as a distinguishing feature of their ministry and the endorsement of the safety of the victim over the preservation of marriage.","2009","2022-01-19 18:34:12","2022-01-19 18:34:12","","","125","","","","","A healing voice","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Fredericton, NB","English","","M.A.","UNBF","","","","","","/home/cvillami/Zotero/storage/V8TKFEWY/Galbraith - 2009 - A healing voice Exploring the response of Protest.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
