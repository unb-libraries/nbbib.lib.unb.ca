Each of the three sections contains two chapters. The first section, ""The Biblical and Theological Foundations for Church Planting,"" traces the central role of ""the people of God"" in God's plan of redemption. The organic nature of the church and the implications of the Great Commission indicate that God intends for the church to multiply itself among the peoples of the world. Biblical models and principles of church planting including the team approach and strategies of the Apostle Paul are provided. The second section, ""The Context for Church Planting,"" analyses the historical development and growth of the Convention together with a description of how changes in the philosophy of ministry of the Board have impacted its effectiveness in this task. An in-depth analysis of church planting methodologies and growth trends in churches planted in the last fifteen years provides the basis for the plan of ministry that is developed in the last section. The third section, ""The Strategy for Church Planting,"" includes a chapter on the selection and mentoring of church planters. A recruitment strategy and a structured interview is developed. A plan including new policies and practices will enable the Board to respond to inquiries from churches and Associations for assistance with church planting ministries. A specific strategy to initiate church planting in the urban Associations is developed. God designed the church to grow numerically, which includes the planting of new churches. A group of those churches have mandated the Home Mission Board to equip them for this task. This strategy has a firm biblical foundation while embracing the historic Baptist principle of the autonomy of the local church.","1993","2022-01-19 18:32:36","2022-01-19 18:32:36","","","259","","","","","","","","","","Fuller Theological Seminary, Doctor of Ministry Program","Pasadena, CA","English","","D.Min.","LAC","","","","","","/home/cvillami/Zotero/storage/MHCV82DR/Gardner - 1993 - A Home Mission Board strategy for church planting .pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Baptist","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During 1905-06, the United Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces formed from the union of the Maritime Convention of Maritime Baptists, the Free Baptists of New Brunswick, and the Free Baptists of Nova Scotia. Similarly in 1925, the United Church of Baptists of Nova Scotia formed, joining the United Church of Canada from the dominion's Congregationalists, Methodists, and two-thirds of its Presbyterians. The article compares and contrasts these formations, concluding the Regular (Calvinist) and Free (Arminian) Baptists of the Maritimes were able to unite largely because they were both formed in late-18th-century revival movements, retained a commitment to a believer's church, and practiced baptism by immersion. Also, the growth of capitalism and government had promoted a sense of free moral agency that weakened Calvinism. Regionalism also played a part in the rejection of union with the American Free Will Baptists in favor of union across theological lines within the Maritimes.","2004","2022-01-19 18:32:36","2022-01-19 18:32:36","","125-146","","2","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","UNBF, UdeM, Acadia","","","","","<p>Accession Number: 22905653; Goodwin, Daniel C.; Source Info: Spring2004, Vol. 41 Issue 2, p125; Note: 98 notes.; Historical Period: 1777 to 1925; Subject Term: UNITED churches; Subject Term: CHRISTIAN union; Subject Term: ECUMENICAL movement; Subject Term: UNITED churches & Christian union; Subject Term: BAPTISTS; Subject: CANADA; Subject: MARITIME Provinces; Number of Pages: 22p; Document Type: Article; Full Text Word Count: 11518</p>; <p>Accession Number: 22905653; Goodwin, Daniel C.; Source Info: Spring2004, Vol. 41 Issue 2, p125; Note: 98 notes.; Historical Period: 1777 to 1925; Subject Term: UNITED churches; Subject Term: CHRISTIAN union; Subject Term: ECUMENICAL movement; Subject Term: UNITED churches & Christian union; Subject Term: BAPTISTS; Subject: CANADA; Subject: MARITIME Provinces; Number of Pages: 22p; Document Type: Article; Full Text Word Count: 11518</p>","","","BAPTISTS; CANADA; MARITIME Provinces; CHRISTIAN union; ECUMENICAL movement; UNITED churches; UNITED churches & Christian union","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rooted in the enthusiastic New Light religion of the First Great Awakening in Nova Scotia, this Christian spirituality was transferred to the Regular Baptist experience in the Maritimes during the first half of the nineteenth century. This transition was directed by a group of ""founders,"" later known as ""Fathers,"" of whom three--Harris Harding, Joseph Crandall, and Edward Manning--are examined in detail. The piety advocated and modeled by these ""Patriarchs""--which became known as the ""Faith of the Fathers""--was characterized by the revival, the New Birth and its ritualization in immersionist baptism. In spite of the denominational structures created around this collection of beliefs and practices, the ""Faith of the Fathers"" remained largely intact and continued to embody many characteristics of late eighteenth-century New Lightism. It fell to the second generation of Regular Baptist preachers to defend and advance this religious tradition in the post 1820 period. The piety and ministerial practice of Charles Tupper, Ingram Bill and Samuel Elder--all second generation preachers--during the 1820s, 1830s and 1840s reveal a remarkable continuity and faithfulness to the spirituality of the patriarchs. During the Maritime Baptismal controversy (1811-1848) a number of key second generation Regular Baptist preachers engaged in both ""popular"" and ""academic"" debate to defend immersionist baptism, their identity-giving ritual. Although many preachers became confident and polished denominational apologists during this period, the ""collective"" confidence and identity of the Maritime Regular Baptist community was shaken by the 1850s when the ""Fathers"" began to die in quick succession. This ""crisis"" was largely resolved by the mid-1850s as the denomination renewed its commitment to the ""Faith of Fathers"" and recognized within their tradition a wide-ranging and multi-faceted approach to piety and church life.","1997","2022-01-19 18:32:36","2022-01-19 18:32:36","","","389","","","","","","","","","","Queen's University","Kingston, ON","English","","Ph.D.","Queen's","","","","","","/home/cvillami/Zotero/storage/REKHJEZP/Goodwin - 1997 - The faith of the fathers Evangelical piety of M.pdf","","","nineteenth century; Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
