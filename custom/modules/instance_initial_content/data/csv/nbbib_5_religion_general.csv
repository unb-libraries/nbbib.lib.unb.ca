C. Keirstead was a leading Maritime social scientist, philosopher, and professor at the University of New Brunswick from 1908 to 1944. This article examines the formation of his social thought in an attempt to address the current debate among historians about whether or not social scientists in early-20th-century English Canada embraced modern thought at the expense of their Christian worldview, thereby helping to accelerate secularization. His writings reveal that he was not an agent of secularization, for although Keirstead embraced many aspects of modernity he continued to draw upon the Baptist religion of his youth and maintained a Christian outlook throughout his career.

New emotional attitudes are being created. How are these to be related to religious ideals? 1. If the church exists solely to save the individual for a future life, no social leadership is engendered. 2. If it be held that the regeneration of individuals will automatically lead to social reforms, it becomes evident that mere good will is not sufficient without detailed knowledge. Moreover a person's attitudes are largely determined by the stimulus of his environment. 3. If the minister confines himself to establish general truths, avoiding controversial questions, he will inevitably become a defender of conventional ideals, and will furnish no insight into new problems. 4. The only alternative is a really accurate knowledge of facts and forces in the social struggle. The minister today should have ""the best training in the social sciences our universities can provide.""","1922","2022-01-19 18:34:59","2022-01-19 18:34:59","","44-57","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","LAC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"VBK6PBDF","thesis","2001","Willigar, Marlene J.","Maritime Woman's Christian Temperance Union, 1875–1895: Labouring for a temperate society, The","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/pqdtglobal/docview/304773839/abstract/47EF72FABB9E499APQ/53","Throughout the late-nineteenth century, the Maritime Woman's Christian Temperance Union stood at the forefront of the region's temperance activity aided by their innovative programs and effective political lobbying and educational methods. Their reform work with its social purity emphasis represented an expanded temperance ideology, which pushed their social mandate beyond the boundaries set by earlier temperance organizations. Together their contemporary methods and ideas enabled them to influence the middle-class and gender ideals of the period. Working as a regional force, the Maritime WCTU was successful especially in the work of children's character formation programs. They were able to gain the support and assistance of the state and religious authoritative bodies, the government and the church, to implement compulsory scientific temperance teaching in the public schools and gospel temperance teaching in many of the evangelical Sunday schools. Their juvenile work, with its contemporary pedagogical techniques and broad temperance message, extended the teaching of temperate life choices to Maritime children through leisure-time activities. The popular Maritime mothers' meetings, with its strong eugenics' emphasis, worked to equip mothers' with proper knowledge and skills to help them build temperate families. As the nineteenth century drew to a close, it became apparent that their individual reform programs were part of a larger nationalistic social vision, the establishment of a temperate Canada. The Maritime WCTU fought for woman's suffrage in the anticipation that it would allow them to further advance and expand their reform work.","2001","2022-01-19 18:34:59","2022-01-19 18:34:59","2018-08-21 13:39:11","","186","","","","","The Maritime Woman's Christian Temperance Union, 1875–1895","","","","","Saint Mary's University","Halifax, NS","English","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","","","/home/cvillami/Zotero/storage/CRGRIPR8/Willigar - 2001 - The Maritime Woman's Christian Temperance Union, 1.pdf","","","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
