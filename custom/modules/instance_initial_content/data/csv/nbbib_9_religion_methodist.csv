The neglect of lay religion, however, has left this hypothesis untested. In the two decades following the first New Brunswick census of religion in 1861, Wesleyan Methodists remained the single largest religious group in the parish of St. Stephen. Yet the dynamics and demography of church growth show that low and fluid church involvement characterized both the rural settlements and expanding villages of this pre-industrial parish. By their remarkably varied and independent choices of religious affiliation, lay men and women determined the size and nature of Methodist communities and anticipated modern 'consumer religion'. Nevertheless, the content of their piety remained in essential continuity with the Methodist tradition. In fact, associational fluidity was rooted in the nature of Methodist belief, worship, and polity.

This argument has linked Methodism to this identity chiefly through the interpretation of evangelicalism as a religious culture, rather than through the socio-economic positions of Methodists themselves. This dissertation explores the extent to which Methodists in the parish of St. Stephen, New Brunswick, were associated with any one socio-economic position. It examines the relationship between gender and Methodist piety, the economic practices of local churches, and patterns of church involvement among different socio-economic groups. This community study draws on both qualitative and quantitative sources, profiling 2,580 Methodist church members, lay leaders, or adherents. Neither Methodist church members nor adherents in St. Stephen were demographically and socially homogenous groups. Although most lay leaders were relatively prosperous men, some were not, and some leaders were women. Most church members were women who joined at all stages of the life course; only a minority were men, primarily older and married men. The poor were neither over nor underrepresented, and church members reflected the socio-economic composition of local Protestants as a whole. In contrast to the founders of a socially homogenous Congregationalist church which emerged out of a Methodist schism, Methodist lay leaders, church members, and adherents still fit the model of the socially diverse church.","2004","2022-01-19 18:33:43","2022-01-19 18:33:43","","","421","","","","","","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Fredericton, NB","English","","Ph.D.","UNBF","","","","","","/home/cvillami/Zotero/storage/AJ8BX3IJ/Lane - 2004 - Methodist church members, lay leaders, and socio-e.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; New Brunswick; Church members; Lay leaders; Methodist; Socioeconomic position; St. Stephen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"BX3WIEKR","thesis","1997","Maxwell, Arthur W.","Beliefs Concerning the Doctrine of Entire Sanctification Held by Lay Full Members of the Atlantic District of the Wesleyan Church","","","","","http://www.collectionscanada.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/ftp04/nq21871.pdf","Methodist, Wesleyan, Reformed Baptist, Doctrine of sanctification  The purpose of this study has been to identify and describe the beliefs concerning the doctrine of entire sanctification currently held by lay full members of the Atlantic District of The Wesleyan Church. The Wesleyan Church has a rich heritage in Methodism and can trace its roots back to eighteenth century England and Methodism's founder, John Wesley. Wesley stressed the doctrine of entire sanctification and taught that all believers could experience a clean heart filled with perfect love in this life. This doctrine was successfully transplanted into early American Methodism and subsequently into The Wesleyan Church. The Atlantic District of The Wesleyan Church has not always been a part of this rich Methodist heritage. Until 1966, this district was an independent denomination known as The Alliance of The Reformed Baptist Church of Canada. The Reformed Baptists organized as a denomination in Woodstock, New Brunswick, November 3, 1888, as a result of the disfellowshipping of five ministers of The Free Christian Baptist Church for preaching and teaching the doctrine of entire sanctification. In July, 1966, The Reformed Baptist Church merged with The Wesleyan Methodist Church (now The Wesleyan Church) and became The Atlantic District of that denomination. The qualitative paradigm and case study design was selected as the most appropriate methodology for meeting the requirements of this study. A random sample of forty lay full members was selected from a representative case selected within The Atlantic District of The Wesleyan Church. Guided interviews were conducted with participants in order to determine their views on various aspects of the doctrine of entire sanctification. The data reveals that only 55% of lay full members in the representative case profess to be entirely sanctified. Seventy-two percent of participants state that preaching is the major contributor to their understanding of this doctrine. From the data it is also evident that there is a general lack of understanding of the doctrine of entire sanctification among lay full members of the representative case in The Atlantic District.","1997","2022-01-19 18:33:43","2022-01-19 18:33:43","","","179","","","","","","","","","","Canadian Theological Seminary (Canada)","Canada","English","","D.Min.","LAC","","","","","","/home/cvillami/Zotero/storage/7RW88GLJ/Maxwell - 1997 - Beliefs concerning the doctrine of entire sanctifi.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the 1920's the college considered moving to Halifax and joining in a college union scheme, but rejected the scheme and returned to the early ideal of serving rural Maritimers from Sackville. 3 tables, 116 notes.","1980","2022-01-19 18:33:43","2022-01-19 18:33:43","","35-66","","1","10","","Acadiensis","","","","","","","","","","","UNBF","","","","","<p>Accession Number: 45956686; Reid, John G.; Source Info: Fall1980, Vol. 10 Issue 1, p35; Historical Period: 1862 to 1927; Subject Term: UNIVERSITIES & colleges; Subject: CANADA; Subject: SACKVILLE (N.B.); Number of Pages: 32p; Document Type: Article</p>; <p>Accession Number: 45956686; Reid, John G.; Source Info: Fall1980, Vol. 10 Issue 1, p35; Historical Period: 1862 to 1927; Subject Term: UNIVERSITIES & colleges; Subject: CANADA; Subject: SACKVILLE (N.B.); Number of Pages: 32p; Document Type: Article</p>","","","CANADA; UNIVERSITIES & colleges; Mount Allison College; SACKVILLE (N.B.); WESLEYAN Methodist Church","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eleven years later the Sackville academy opened its ladies' branch. By 1914 the accomplishments of the drawing room largely dominated this institution. Nevertheless, women's education had a considerable influence on degree-granting Mount Allison College, established adjacent to the academies in 1862. In 1872 Mount Allison became coeducational, and in 1875 it became the first institution in the British Empire to award a bachelor's degree to a woman. More importantly Mount Allison was responsible for a significant widening of educational opportunities for women in the Maritimes.","1983","2022-01-19 18:33:43","2022-01-19 18:33:43","","3-33","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","UNBF","","","","","","","https://login.proxy.hil.unb.ca/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ahl&AN=45816830&site=ehost-live&scope=site&scope=cite","","CANADA; NEW Brunswick; UNIVERSITIES & colleges; Mount Allison College; WOMEN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
