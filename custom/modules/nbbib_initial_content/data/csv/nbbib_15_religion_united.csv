The present article explores the advantages and limitations of such data by analyzing the evolution of key church indicators of the United Church of Canada over the past four decades. Figures regarding church membership, child baptisms, and funerals are examined and compared with demographic data from four Canadian regions. Results show that virtually all United Church statistics are in decline with regard to larger society since the 1970s. However, there are regional variations, most notably in the Atlantic provinces, which show later and lesser rates of decline.

During 1905-06, the United Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces formed from the union of the Maritime Convention of Maritime Baptists, the Free Baptists of New Brunswick, and the Free Baptists of Nova Scotia. Similarly in 1925, the United Church of Baptists of Nova Scotia formed, joining the United Church of Canada from the dominion's Congregationalists, Methodists, and two-thirds of its Presbyterians. The article compares and contrasts these formations, concluding the Regular (Calvinist) and Free (Arminian) Baptists of the Maritimes were able to unite largely because they were both formed in late-18th-century revival movements, retained a commitment to a believer's church, and practiced baptism by immersion. Also, the growth of capitalism and government had promoted a sense of free moral agency that weakened Calvinism. Regionalism also played a part in the rejection of union with the American Free Will Baptists in favor of union across theological lines within the Maritimes.","2004","2022-01-19 18:32:36","2022-01-19 18:32:36","","125-146","","2","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","UNBF, UdeM, Acadia","","","","","<p>Accession Number: 22905653; Goodwin, Daniel C.; Source Info: Spring2004, Vol. 41 Issue 2, p125; Note: 98 notes.; Historical Period: 1777 to 1925; Subject Term: UNITED churches; Subject Term: CHRISTIAN union; Subject Term: ECUMENICAL movement; Subject Term: UNITED churches & Christian union; Subject Term: BAPTISTS; Subject: CANADA; Subject: MARITIME Provinces; Number of Pages: 22p; Document Type: Article; Full Text Word Count: 11518</p>; <p>Accession Number: 22905653; Goodwin, Daniel C.; Source Info: Spring2004, Vol. 41 Issue 2, p125; Note: 98 notes.; Historical Period: 1777 to 1925; Subject Term: UNITED churches; Subject Term: CHRISTIAN union; Subject Term: ECUMENICAL movement; Subject Term: UNITED churches & Christian union; Subject Term: BAPTISTS; Subject: CANADA; Subject: MARITIME Provinces; Number of Pages: 22p; Document Type: Article; Full Text Word Count: 11518</p>","","","BAPTISTS; CANADA; MARITIME Provinces; CHRISTIAN union; ECUMENICAL movement; UNITED churches; UNITED churches & Christian union","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The women undertook preaching, teaching and medical duties there. From the Maritime Provinces to Sichuan is not only a lengthy geographic distance; there were also major differences between the two social and cultural situations. Sichuan was traditionally called ""Shu"". There is a famous verse describing the road to Sichuan: the road to Shu is as hard as the road to heaven. However, like missionaries of the previous generation, A. Jean L. Stewart, Katharine B. Hockin and Grace M. Webster set their feet on the hard road to Shu. Why did these women choose to become missionaries in that very remote corner of the world? What did they do there and what kind of interactions took place during their years of work? In order to address the questions mentioned above, the thesis approaches the three women through their life stories. They were members of the second generation of women missionaries who were sent to overseas missions after the UCC was established in 1925.","1993","2022-01-19 18:34:27","2022-01-19 18:34:27","","","144","","","","","","","","","","Saint Mary's University","Halifax, NS","English","","M.A.","SMU","","","","","","/home/cvillami/Zotero/storage/V8MQ4VG8/Song - 1993 - A study of three women missionaries of the United .pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; A.
