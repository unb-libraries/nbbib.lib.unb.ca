Therefore, they examine dual-career problems and parental concerns with regard to gender equity. They consider the ramifications of these policies for recruitment and retention of faculty and for the process of tenure and promotion.","1996","2024-09-24 17:53:57","2024-09-24 17:53:57","","204-226","","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","College teachers; COLLEGE teachers – Family relationships; Discrimination in higher education; Dual-career families; Employee fringe benefits; Families; Family policy – United States; Maternity leave; Women college teachers; Work & family","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With multiple definitions for the word leadership' and vast numbers of leadership styles, it can be difficult to identity what exactly is meant when discussing library leadership. This literature review brings together 10 years of scholarly research on leadership in the library as it relates to LIS education. Through a close evaluation of this literature, a more holistic understanding of leadership' as a concept in LIS education can be better understood. Several topics are highlighted and discussed including the ambiguity in definitions of 'leadership', the qualities of library leaders, leadership in LIS curriculum, library leadership and organization change, and library leadership and new librarians. For this review, the definition of LIS curriculum includes professional association leadership programs. Closing this literature review are recommendations for incorporating leadership education and mentorship opportunities into MLIS programs.

Compared with those from a Western culture, those students are not as knowledgeable about the library resources and information services in an academic setting. Design/methodology/approach – The paper describes the strategies for marketing academic library, resources and information services to Asian international students and the challenges faced by reference librarians dealing with Asian international students. It looks also at what information literacy programs and activities are suitable to accommodate the information needs of Asian international students and what teaching methodology should be used. The paper draws upon the author's personal experiences and observations as an International Students Information Librarian who works closely with international student. Surveys were used to find out whether Asian international students had experiences of using academic libraries; and whether they are aware of the services and resources available for their study in a Western academic setting. Findings – Academic libraries need to market their services and resources proactively to Asian international students who are not familiar with the services and resources in a Western academic library. Reference librarians need to consider these learners' characteristics, language proficiency, learning styles and their subjects of interests so that the teaching methodology and examples used are effective with these students. Originality/value – The paper adds value to the body of literature on information literacy programs and information services for international students, who are totally alien to the Western academic environment.

This article highlights the evaluation process, including relevant evaluation questions and selection of indicators, use of a mixed-methods approach, and development of instruments. We give particular attention to the utilization of longitudinal participants in order to document the project's effectiveness. Project evaluators used demographic and performance data, classroom observations, and online journals to determine the efficacy of the training provided to these longitudinal participants. For these three activities, we discuss the development and deployment of instruments and offer some preliminary findings. Finally, the article concludes with a brief discussion of internal project assessment and its role in project refinement.

Analysis of the data by chi-square standardized residuals identified the days of the week, and the times during the day of heavy and light use. Data sort identified the heavy/light use weeks, months, and semesters. Descriptive analysis also established the variability and the range of data. When comparing data from week to week for the random sample years with the data collected by every hour for every day of the week for the non-random sample years, this revealed a very similar pattern. Heavy days, weeks, hours, and months fell into a similar pattern from semester to semester and from year to year. Other academic libraries can follow this model and apply it to their work environment after adjusting for their academic calendar and user behavior.

Emphasis is placed on a popular and highly personalized research appointment service; a robust program of course-related library instruction; reliance on students to help staff the reference desk and make effective referrals; developing and maintaining strong relationships with teaching faculty; and creating welcoming spaces conducive to research, studying, socializing, and interacting with library staff.

The field of UD supports a framework that can also be used to enhance the field of education. A number of constructs have been established that have as their goal the improvement of learning environments to benefit people with a wide range of characteristics. One model is called Universal Design for Instruction (UDI) and another one is Universal Design for Learning (UDL). This article investigates whether the application of the UDL construct will influence the design of technology-enhanced courses. The UDL construct's goal is to create flexible learning environments that can reduce learning barriers and support the needs of a wide range of learners. The authors discuss how UDL learning principles and options are used in technology-enhanced courses. Using UDL principles, technology-enhanced course design is an effective way to create flexible learning environments for learners. This format adds a philosophical structure to technology-enhanced courses that can change the education landscape and create a more dynamic learning experience for all involved.","2010","2024-09-24 17:53:58","2024-09-24 17:53:58","","43-51","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Access to Education; Student Evaluation; Blended Learning; Educational Principles; Electronic Learning; Higher education; Learner Engagement; Technology Uses in Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Really understanding reference service activity requires tracking and assessment. This study reviews reference transaction assessment methodologies of New York State academic and public libraries. Results indicate that the majority of organizations use transaction data for internal and external reporting, with 50% or more also using data for adjusting service hours, staffing, and monitoring trends. More than 70% would like to improve their assessment of transaction data. The majority continue to use handwritten tick mark or tally sheets, while a number of tools designed or adapted for reference assessment provide options for additional automation of the process.

Results of the longitudinal survey revealed a large and consistent gap in achieving tenure between women who had early babies and men who had early babies and showed that, overall, women with late babies or without children had a rate of achieving tenure that was higher than women with early babies. Results showed that, overall, women who achieved tenure were unlikely to have children in the household. Results of the 2000 survey showed that married women with children were much more likely than others to cite children as one reason for changing their career goals away from academia, that married women without children were more ambivalent than men about staying in academia, and that single women without children were more likely than men to consider leaving academia.

The research examined four geographical areas. The policy prescriptions behind integrated care were viewed in historical context. Two key aspects of current policy, the drive from central government and the focus on users and outcomes, were analysed in terms of first, the purpose and design behind the initiative, and second the early implementation experience. The policy purposes of collaborative partnering and user focus were clearly observed. However, the early implementation experience, while showing that partnership structures were in place, indicated differing levels of authority and responsibility from health and local authority managers causing some frustration for local partnership management. The research showed that in practice the extent of user-outcome focus was limited. Users and clients were involved in agreeing to the design of their care package as demanded by legislation, yet there was little evidence of a broader collective, participative dimension. There was some devolution of financial authority to managers at the client interface level and this marked a clear difference from earlier practice, but the approach to this was patchy with some of the areas studied completely separating assessment and authorization of care processes. The focus on local outcome – effectiveness – measures to calibrate achievement was less well developed, giving support to those who regard as unlikely the comprehensive adoption of such approaches in the public spending arena. The article concludes by outlining the significance of the Joint Future initiative for policy development as well as indicating a research agenda for some wider debates in public policy and management.","2003-07","2024-09-24 17:53:58","2024-09-24 17:53:58","","39-56","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design - Quantitative survey questionnaire. Setting - A research university in Australia. Subjects - 1,029 first year students in the health sciences. Methods - First year students enrolled in the health sciences were asked to complete a paper questionnaire in their first week of classes in 2009. The 20 question survey was distributed in student tutorial groups. The first 10 questions collected information on student demographics, expected library use, and existing information seeking behaviour. The remaining 10 questions tested students' understanding of information literacy concepts. Data collected from the survey were analyzed using the statistical software SPSS. Main Results - Most of the students who responded to the questionnaire were between the ages of 16 and 21 (84.3%) with only 2.2% over the age of 40. Approximately 15% of respondents had completed some postsecondary university or vocational education prior to enrolling in their current program. The students ranked Google, a friend, and a book as the top three places they would go to find information on something they knew little about. Google was also the most popular choice for finding a scholarly article (35% of respondents), followed by the library catalogue (21%). A large proportion of students correctly answered questions relating to identifying appropriate search terms. For example, one third of the students selected the correct combination of search concepts for a provided topic, and 77% identified that the choice of search phrase could negatively impact search results. Students also demonstrated prior knowledge of the Boolean operator AND, with 38% correctly identifying its use in the related question. Most students were also able to identify key markers of a website's credibility. Questions relating to ethical information use and scholarly literature proved more challenging. Almost half (45%) of the students said that they did not know the characteristics of a peer reviewed journal article. Twenty five percent of respondents indicated that citing an information source was only necessary in the case of direct quotes, with only 28% correctly identifying the need for citing both quotes and paraphrasing. Only 23% were able to select the example of a journal citation from the list presented. Conclusion - Students enter university with existing strengths in concept identification and basic search formulation, but require the most assistance with locating and identifying scholarly literature and how to cite it appropriately in their work. The findings will inform the development of an online information literacy assessment tool to assist incoming students in identifying areas where they may require additional support as they transition to university.

Social enterprises are organizations intent on using the power of the marketplace to solve social and environmental problems. Although their popularity as an approach to business is growing, they are beginning to face a variety of challenges. To help ensure their survival, the paper argues that key business and ethical criteria need to be considered at key stages of the social-action selection process. The Social Action Framework (SAF) is introduced as mechanism to help managers make more effective social-action choices. It is explained using anecdotal evidence from a variety of organizations. In addition, the criteria of the SAF are used to generate an action-based definition of social enterprise and differentiate it from other organizational approaches to social-welfare enhancement.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper begins with a literature review of recent library collaborations with student services areas such as international student centers, study abroad, multicultural student services, career services and writing centers, and then outlines a general rubric employed at the University of Illinois used to develop, implement and assess library partnerships with these student services units. Findings - A current literature review reveals a new and often overlooked information literacy niche that exists within the student services realm. These collaborations are generally welcomed by the partners, heighten students' access to information, and incorporate information literacy objectives into students' lives beyond the classroom. Practical implications - This paper highlights an often overlooked area in student services units for collaboration on information literacy programming and the number of positive associated outcomes. Originality/value - This paper describes a new and unique approach to connecting students with the library's services beyond the traditional faculty-based approach.

Design/methodology/approach - Statistics from 1992/1993 through 2007/2008 were examined to see whether gate counts and questions asked went up, down or remained steady. Findings - Technology changes and user expectations have affected reference service at Regent University Library. Even though the number of patrons coming to the library has declined, the number of questions being asked through e-mail and the telephone has risen slightly. Librarians have also seen an increase in students making appointments for extended assistance. Research limitations/implications - This case study examines the decline in gate counts and reference activity at one academic library during a period of enrollment growth. Changes to the layout and location of the reference desk resulted in an increase of in-person reference transactions. Practical implications - Evaluation of usage statistics documents the strong correlation between library visits and reference transactions. Both of these figures have dropped significantly during the past decade, and only recently have shown increases. Following the relocation of the reference desk, the library recorded increases in total reference questions and in-person questions. There has been an increase in the proportion of questions received in-person at the new location. Originality/value - A case study covers the changing role of the reference desk at one academic library from a separate, free standing desk to a consolidated information commons model. Each stage in the development is discussed, with analysis of the impact on reference question activity and the effect of close proximity to the front door of the library.

Incorporating information literacy can support management educators in their need to balance disciplinary content, departmental curriculum, and broader educational goals that support the preparation of future managers. This article begins with a review of core information literacy concepts and standards. An in-depth discussion of information literacy challenges on campus and in the workplace follows. Next, the authors offer an evolving case example that illustrates the incorporation of information literacy skills and concepts into an introductory management course.

This, together with health concerns about the use of chemicals in the production of foods, raises the question of whether it might be feasible to return to organic methods for the production of rice in Indonesia. This paper describes an experiment along these lines. It was found that organic farming methods could be used with only a small decline in yields per hectare, but that local demand for organic rice produced domestically was not strong enough to generate sales at prices that would cover higher production costs. If organic farming methods are to be adopted in Indonesia, therefore, it may be necessary to focus on exporting to countries where there is a potentially strong consumer demand for organic rice.","2004","2024-09-24 17:53:58","2024-09-24 17:53:58","","243-252","","2","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural Extension Services Q160; Agricultural R&D; Agricultural Technology; Agriculture: Aggregate Supply and Demand Analysis; Prices Q110; Administrative Processes in Public Organizations; and Rural Analyses O180; Bureaucracy; Corruption D730; Economic Development: Regional; Formal and Informal Sectors; Institutional Arrangements O170; Irrigation Q150; Land Ownership and Tenure; Land Reform; Land Use; Shadow Economy; Urban","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The evolution of DNA science is traced from the discovery of its structure in 1953 to the 2000 federally-funded Human Genome Project. The ways that courts evaluate DNA evidence are examined, and the ethical implications of cloning, genetic modifications and the death penalty are discussed.","2003","2024-09-24 17:53:58","2024-09-24 17:53:58","","","418","","","","","","","","","","Perseus Publishing","Cambridge, MA","","","","","","","","","","","","Capital punishment; Courts; Criminal Investigations; Dna Typing; Evidence; Forensic sciences; Genetics; Investigations; Problem solving","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The international dimension of higher education is becoming increasingly important, complex, and confusing. It is therefore timely to reexamine and update the conceptual frameworks underpinning the notion of inter-nationalization in light of today’s changes and challenges. The purpose of this article is to study internationalization at both the institutional and national/sector level. Both levels are important. The national/sector level has an important influence on the international dimension through policy, funding, programs, and regulatory frameworks. Yet it is usually at the institutional level that the real process of internationalization is taking place. This article analyses the meaning, definition, rationales, and approaches of internationalization using a bottom-up (institutional) approach and a top-down (national/sector) approach and examines the dynamic relationship between these two levels. Key policy issues and questions for the future direction of internationalization are identified.","2004-03-01","2024-09-24 17:53:58","2024-09-24 17:53:58","","5-31","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since 2003, OSU has participated in L-Net, Oregon's statewide virtual reference service. As a participant, OSU is eligible to use the Tutor.com software to create a local virtual reference service for the OSU community and has been encouraged by the state to do so. In this paper we share OSU libraries' reasons for creating a separate queue for our community, our experiences with it so far, and our plans for the future of L-Net OSU.

Focus groups were conducted with students with below-proficient skills to determine their instructional preferences. The findings from the focus groups indicate that students place a high value on personal relevance in the knowledge and skills they are learning, and they prefer a combination of demonstration and hands-on activities, interaction with the instructor and other students, and the availability of supplemental instructional materials in the form of handouts. In addition, they feel that incentives to participate in instruction are crucial and that a number of communication strategies are needed to advertise effectively the availability of instructional sessions.

As part of the merger, the frontline services–the computing support desk and the library reference desk-were combined into a single help desk designed to offer a single point of service, with backup by a second tier of computing, instructional technology, enterprise information, and library consultants. The author reviews the literature on the service implications of merging libraries and computing and provides an overview of the new organizational structure of Lehigh's Information Resources. The rest of the paper traces the development of the LTS (Library and Technology Services) integrated help desk over ten years and describes management issues such as training, staffing, referral, work flow, assessment, and other topics.

Should it be? Can it be? This major work of social and intellectual history reveals how such questions have driven business education and shaped American management and society for more than a century. The book is also a call for reform. Rakesh Khurana shows that university-based business schools were founded to train a professional class of managers in the mold of doctors and lawyers but have effectively retreated from that goal, leaving a gaping moral hole at the center of business education and perhaps in management itself. Khurana begins in the late nineteenth century, when members of an emerging managerial elite, seeking social status to match the wealth and power they had accrued, began working with major universities to establish graduate business education programs paralleling those for medicine and law. Constituting business as a profession, however, required codifying the knowledge relevant for practitioners and developing enforceable standards of conduct. Khurana, drawing on a rich set of archival material from business schools, foundations, and academic associations, traces how business educators confronted these challenges with varying strategies during the Progressive era and the Depression, the postwar boom years, and recent decades of freewheeling capitalism.""–Jacket.; Contents: Chapter:Introduction._Title:Business education and the social transformation of American management_Page:1; Contents: Chapter:I._Title:The professionalization project in American business education, 1881-1941; Contents: Chapter:1._Title:An occupation in search of legitimacy_Page:23; Contents: Chapter:2._Title:Ideas of order : science, the professions, and the university in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century America_Page:51; Contents: Chapter:3._Title:The invention of the university-based business school_Page:87; Contents: Chapter:4._Title:""A very ill-defined institution"" : the business school as aspiring professional school_Page:137; Contents: Chapter:II._Title:The institutionalization of business schools, 1941-1970; Contents: Chapter:5._Title:The changing institutional field in the postwar era_Page:195; Contents: Chapter:6._Title:Discipline the business school faculty : the impact of the foundations_Page:233; Contents: Chapter:III._Title:The triumph of the market and the abandonment of the professionalism project, 1970-the present; Contents: Chapter:7._Title:Unintended consequences : the post-Ford business school and the fall of managerialism_Page:291; Contents: Chapter:8._Title:Business schools in the marketplace_Page:333; Contents: Chapter:Epilogue._Title:Ideas of order revisited : markets, hierarchies, and communities_Page:363","2007","2024-09-24 17:53:58","2024-09-24 17:53:58","","","531","","","","","","","","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton","","","","","","","","","","","","EDUCATION; Business education–United States; Business schools–United States; Higher–United States; Management–Vocational guidance–United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few studies have compared the views and assessments of students, librarians, and instructors. Through survey methods, this case study was conducted to understand student, librarian, and instructor perceptions of information literacy instruction and students' information literacy skills in two different types of courses at the Catholic University of America. The results indicate that notable differences are associated with the respondent's role as well as the course involvement of the respondent. Students who were involved in a course with consistent inclusion of a substantive information literacy-related assignment tended to rate the effectiveness, importance, and impacts of information literacy instruction, and their own information literacy skills, higher than those in a course with an inconsistent level of engagement with information literacy. Students' assignment grades were positively correlated with their self-ratings of information literacy skills in both courses. In addition, students rated their own information literacy skills higher and rated the importance and impacts of information literacy instruction lower than librarians or instructors did. Implications and recommendations are also addressed.

The major areas of focus are inadequate defense, prosecutorial misconduct, judicial overrides, execution of the mentally retarded, racial discrimination, and geographic disparities. Overall, the people of the state want a criminal justice system that is fair and effective. Although skepticism remains that the unfairness that has characterized the death penalty in AL and other death penalty states for so long can ever be completely eliminated, basic decency requires all citizens of good will to try. The AL legislature, the courts, and the governor are therefore urged to consider a number of recommendations, including a moratorium on all executions in AL, the establishment of a statewide public defender system ensuring that all defendants are represented by qualified attorneys, the establishment of a review process for claims of mental retardation by death row inmates whose execution dates are approaching, and the establishment of postconviction DNA testing procedures.","2005","2024-09-24 17:53:58","2024-09-24 17:53:58","","","27","","","","","","","","","","American Civil Liberties Union","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","Capital punishment; Criminal justice system; Death Penalty; Geographic factors; Mental disorders; Misconduct; Racial differences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the face of two greedy institutions, the academy and parenthood (especially motherhood), do they employ the same sorts of strategies in their quest to attain tenure-track jobs, and are those strategies successful? In this study we use a longitudinal survey of sociology Ph.D.s to investigate the availability and use of three types of resources and strategies during graduate school, and find that they all have important effects on the chances of obtaining a tenure-track position at a research or doctoral university. We find that some institutional resources are not equally distributed in graduate school, with mother's least likely to obtain them, but are significant for attainment of tenure-track positions. Resource-based strategies, including presenting papers and publishing articles while in graduate school, have a positive and significant effect on all groups' attainment of tenure-track positions. Family-based strategies such as child-spacing strategies are also significant; women who have children during graduate school have lower odds of immediately obtaining tenure-track jobs at research and doctoral universities, although access to resources and the ability to use these resources helps significantly.

The objective of this study was to determine the cross-sectional associations of leg length with measures of insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSSubjects (n = 462) at risk for type 2 diabetes were recruited into the PROMISE longitudinal cohort. Leg length was calculated from sitting and standing height at the 3-year clinical examination. Glucose tolerance status was determined using an oral glucose tolerance test. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the Matsuda insulin sensitivity index (ISI), while the insulinogenic index over HOMA-IR (IGI/IR) and the insulin secretion sensitivity index 2 (ISSI-2) determined beta-cell function. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted, adjusting for covariates including age, sex, ethnicity, family history of diabetes, waist, and weight.RESULTSLeg length and leg-to-height ratio were significantly associated with HOMA-IR (beta = -0.037, beta = -10.49, respectively; P < 0.0001), ISI (beta = 0.035, beta = 8.83, respectively; P < 0.0001), IGI/IR (beta = 0.021, P < 0.05; beta = 7.60, P < 0.01, respectively), and ISSI-2 (beta = 0.01, P < 0.03; beta = 3.34, P < 0.01, respectively) after adjustment for covariates. The association of shorter leg length with lower insulin sensitivity was most evident for those with high waist circumferences.CONCLUSIONSShorter legs were independently associated with lower insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function, suggesting that early childhood deprivation may increase the risk of developing diabetes.","2013-10-02","2024-09-24 17:53:58","2024-09-24 17:53:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ENG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several years ago, Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton introduced the balanced scorecard, which supplemented traditional financial measures with criteria that measured performance from the perspectives of customers, internal business processes, and learning and growth. The scorecard enabled companies to track financial results while monitoring progress in building the capabilities they would need for growth. Recently, some companies have gone further and discovered the scorecard's value as the cornerstone of a new strategic management system. Traditional management systems rely on financial measures, which bear little relation to progress in achieving long-term strategic objectives. The scorecard introduces four new processes that help companies connect long-term objectives with short-term actions. The first–translating the vision–helps managers build a consensus around the company's strategy and express it in terms that can guide action at the local level. The second–communicating and linking–lets managers communicate their strategy up and down the organization and link it to unit and individual goals. The third–business planning–enables companies to integrate their business and financial plans. The fourth–feedback and learning–gives companies the capacity for strategic learning, which consists of gathering feedback, testing the hypotheses on which strategy was based, and making the necessary adjustments.

However, many college professors only allow the librarian one information literacy session per class to convey these skills each semester. During a library session, active learning technology can be utilized to encourage student participation and hands-on learning. Often, librarians seek other avenues to distribute knowledge to students beyond the library session (e.g., Blackboard, wikis, tutorials, and subject guides). The authors used Interwrite Personal Response Systems (clickers) over two semesters to encourage student engagement during an information literacy session in a course originally designed for at-risk freshmen, then redesigned for any first-year student. For the second semester, the librarians added pretests and posttests that were administered using Blackboard, the university's course management system. This study explains how a two-semester project integrated information literacy skills into a first-year curriculum, while serving as an instrumental assessment measure for student learning.

Methods - The authors reviewed attempts over the past dozen years by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) and the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) to highlight the unique types of value that special collections and archival resources contribute to academic research libraries. They also examined the results of a large survey of special collections and archives conducted by OCLC Research in 2010. In addition, they investigated efforts by the Society of American Archivists (SAA) dating back to the 1940s to define standardized metrics for gathering and comparing data about archival operations. Finding that the library and archival communities have thus far failed to develop and adopt common metrics and methods for gathering data about the activities of special collections and archives, the authors explored the potential benefits of borrowing concepts for developing user-centered value propositions and metrics from the business community. Results - This study found that there has been a lack of consensus and precision concerning the definition of ""special collections"" and the value propositions they offer, and that most attempts have been limited in their usefulness because they were collections-centric. The study likewise reaffirmed a lack of consensus regarding how to define and measure basic operations performed by special collections and archives, such as circulating materials to users in supervised reading rooms. The review of concepts and metrics for assessing value in the business community, however, suggested new approaches to defining metrics that may be more successful. Conclusion - The authors recommend shifting from collection-centric to user-centric approaches and identifying appropriately precise metrics that can be consistently and widely applied to facilitate cross-institutional comparisons. Adopting a user-centric perspective, they argue, will provide a broader picture of how scholars interact with special collections at different points in the research process, both inside and outside of supervised reading rooms, as well as how undergraduate students change their thinking about evidence through interaction with primary sources. They authors outline the potential benefits of substituting the commonly used ""reader-day"" metric for tabulating reading room visits with a ""reader-hour"" metric and correlating it with item usage data in order to gauge the intensity of reading room use. They also discuss the potential benefits of assessing impact of instructional outreach in special collections and archives through measures of student confidence in pursuing research projects that involve primary sources.

An empirical study of instruction was conducted in both virtual and traditional reference milieus, examining the following three services: Instant messaging (IM), chat, and face-to-face reference. The authors used the same criteria in separate studies of all three services to determine if librarians provided analogous levels of instruction and what factors influenced the likelihood of instruction. Methodologies employed included transcript analysis, observation, and patron surveys. Findings indicated that patrons wanted instruction in their reference transactions, regardless of medium, and that librarians provided it. But instructional techniques used by librarians in virtual reference differ somewhat from those used at the reference desk. The authors conclude that reference transactions, in any medium, represent the patron's point-of-need, thereby presenting the ideal teachable moment.

When a new core curriculum for first-year students was adopted at the City College of New York in the fall of 2008, the City College Library took this opportunity to establish a new approach to teach library research to freshmen. Two library workshops were embedded into a six-credit combined content and writing course. Design/methodology/approach – This paper documents the process by which the City College Library successfully transitioned to the new system and also reflects on the theory and practice of teaching information literacy in an academic setting. Findings – Library workshops embedded within the new core curriculum have clear advantages over previous library instruction. By designing and implementing library workshops to blend with the new course, the Library has become a partner in an innovative first-year program. Practical implications – This study will provide useful information on the teaching and assessment of embedded library instruction and stimulate further thought on the role of information instruction in furthering the mission of undergraduate education. Originality/value – This paper presents opportunities to expand library instruction to the first-year seminar, the most commonly implemented curricular intervention designed for freshman students. By taking part in this important project, the Library becomes an integral participant in the initiative for retention and success for undergraduate education.

Administrative issues have been discussed thoughtfully and thoroughly in publications from the American Library Association (ALA) and CAUSE. Suggests that the newer spaces in academic libraries that provide a public computing center with both library and computing support, often referred to as an information commons, offer perhaps the best opportunity to explore the full and seamless integration of library and computing services at the user level. Focusing on staffing, looks at the information commons as a phenomenon, and then addresses in specific terms the transition at the University of Southern California's Leavey Library from separate reference and software consulting desks to a fully integrated model of services that mirrors the merger of libraries and academic computing which occurred at USC in 1997.","2002","2024-09-24 17:53:58","2024-09-24 17:53:58","","181-186","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated systems; Library and archival services; Library management; PROCESSING (Libraries)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The advent of the internet, search engines and social media require a paradigm shift in the development of these leaders. Whilst much has been written about the required competencies, there seems to be no clear guiding principle on how the development should take place. The authors propose that the development of library leaders is a process, best illustrated through movement through Drotter's Leadership Pipeline. The importance of thinking preferences, based on Herrmann's Whole Brain Model, is highlighted and it is shown how these often clog development through this Pipeline. Utilising data from the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI) assessments of the 120 participants in six of the Centre for African Library Leadership (CALL) development programmes, the authors show how the thinking preferences of these library leaders could enable or detract from their readiness to develop the appropriate competencies in the digital age. Recommendations are made on how best to overcome this to prepare library leaders to deal with the requirements of the digital age consumer.

While these studies offer some useful data, their results may be considered inconclusive because they did not use control groups and therefore had no comparative data regarding outcomes in courses where UDL was not implemented. This paper, which builds on a study published by these authors in a previous issue of JPED (Schelly, Davies, & Spooner, 2011), responds to the gap in the literature by measuring the effectiveness of instructor training regarding the principles of UDL and techniques for its implementation. It does so by comparing student perceptions of instructor teaching methods, as measured by a UDL questionnaire, completed before and after the instructors received UDL training and by comparing those results to a control group of students taking the same course in a different section where instructors did not receive UDL training.

While information literacy efforts continue to grow on campuses across the nation, what is the progress of information literacy instruction with business students? ln order to find out, a survey of librarians at AACSB-accredited schools was conducted. The results of the survey reveal that business information literacy instruction, while widespread and prevalent, is still developing. Collaboration between librarians and business faculty is overwhelmingly described as moderate, and only about a third of respondents have incorporated the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education into their instruction efforts with business students. Assessment of business students' in formation literacy remains an area for continued growth as the majority of librarians report that they do not assess their students' business information literacy. The results of this survey are comparable to the National Information Literacy Survey conducted in 2001. It appears that information literacy, both in general as well as in discipline-specific forms, is evolving.

Methods - Using grounded theory methodology, the study was conducted in an academic library serving a mid-sized medical-doctoral university in western Canada. Twenty-one librarians and support staff who had completed the University Library's Library Leadership Development Program (LLDP) participated in one-on-one interviews of 40-60 minutes duration. Interview transcripts were prepared by the researcher and reviewed by the participants. After editing, those source documents were analyzed to reveal patterns and common threads in the responses. The coding scheme that best fits the data includes the following four headings: skill development, learning opportunities, strategic change management, and shared understanding of organizational vision and values. Results - According to the responses in interviews given by graduates of the Library Leadership Development Program, the library's investment in learning has created a cohort of employees who are: self-aware and engaged, committed to learning and able to develop new skills, appreciative of change and accepting of challenges, or accountable and committed to achieving the organization's vision and values. Conclusion - Competencies and behaviours developed through exposure to leadership development learning opportunities are changing the nature of the organization's culture to be more collaborative, flexible, open and accepting of change and challenge, supportive of learning, able to create and use knowledge, and focussed on achieving the organization's vision and values. These are the characteristics commonly associated with a learning organization.

Some institutions have established policies allowing faculty members with children to work flexible schedules, take leaves of absence, work part time, or stop the tenure clock temporarily. In other cases, people cope by relying on family members or professional child care, putting one spouse's career on hold temporarily, delaying parenthood, or having one child or none. All of these strategies have drawbacks as well as advantages. Librarians facing the parenthood-promotion dilemma should become familiar with their legal rights under the 1978 Civil Rights Act and the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act, obtain the support of their supervisors, and discuss strategies with others in the same situation.","1995","2024-09-24 17:53:58","2024-09-24 17:53:58","","","41-42","","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Employee fringe benefits; Academic librarians – Faculty status; College and university librarians – Status; Women librarians","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first part of the paper focuses on how information literacy was embedded in two modules delivered by the author. An analysis of assessed work submitted by over 180 students shows that they performed well. The perceptions of students on three aspects of information literacy–degree of difficulty, usefulness and competence–are analysed. The paper shows that students have had the opportunity to develop information literacy in different educational contexts. The second part of the paper reports the outcomes of auditing and mapping exercises to determine the extent to which lecturers on the Management programme embed information literacy in their modules. These reveal that most Management lecturers embed information literacy into their modules, despite the absence of a policy. Issues, including appropriate models of delivery, methods of assessment, student support mechanisms, the need for a policy and the value of information literacy in the Management curriculum are discussed. The paper concludes that the skills element of the curriculum is growing. Information literacy is a vital skill for e-learning and should be promoted by academics and librarians preparing graduates for work and lifelong learning.

This paper reports on research into the development and use of PIs in government departments, public agencies and private businesses in the 1980s. This comparative approach shows that the problems of performance assessment and the methods adopted for the design of PI systems, cut across the public/private divide but are related to the specific characteristics of organizations and their environment. The paper further analyses various dimensions of PI systems — notably, the measurement of quality and consumer satisfaction — and examines their implementation and evolution. The life-cycle of PIS suggests a possible prescriptive theory: the ‘mature’ PI model seems to be characterized by being designer-built, parsimonious and timely. The drive towards the development of PI systems, it is concluded, is likely to intensify in the 1990s, in response to the Next Steps initiative and as instruments for the regulation of privatized monopolies.

The survey evaluated the work force and its perceived environment, health, and safety (EHS) performance, with emphasis on the influence of the different cultures and languages. Opportunities for improvement were identified, and an action plan was developed and implemented. Introduction PCI currently operates two Xijiang offshore oil fields in the South China Sea that produce approximately 100,000 BOPD. Partners in this operation include China Natl. Offshore Oil Corp. and Pecten Orient. Operation facilities include two production platforms and one floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) tanker. Almost 400 offshore employees from more than 10 different countries work on these facilities on 28-day-on/28-day-off rotation shifts. More than half are contractor employees. Cultural and language differences impact EHS success significantly in this global operating environment. Evaluation of workers' perception of safety helps identify improvement areas and potential areas of safety concern. Survey objectives are to produce a general picture of the safety culture within Xijiang operations by comparing safety perceptions of expatriates with those of Chinese nationals; by identifying the impact that these differences may have on safety; by evaluating the impact that language differences may have on saf","1999-04-01","2024-09-24 17:53:59","2024-09-24 17:53:59","","74-74-83","","4","51","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, although statistically insignificant, patients with IR (n=31) had lower omentin-1 levels compared to obese children without IR (n=18).Our data indicates that serum omentin 1 levels are i) lower in obese children and ii) negatively correlated with BMI, WC, HOMA-IR and insulin levels suggesting that omentin 1 might be a biomarker for metabolic dysfunction also in childhood and adolescence. Lower omentin 1 levels tended to be associated with insulin resistance however this association failed to reach statistical significance. Further studies in larger populations are needed to better-define the relation of omentin 1 and insulin resistance in obese children.","2013-10-01","2024-09-24 17:53:59","2024-09-24 17:53:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ENG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As greater numbers of students with disabilities atten postsecondary educational institutions, administrators have expressed increased interest in making their programs accessible to all students. This book provides both theoretical and practical guidance for schools as they work to turn this admirable goal into a reality, thereby making a crucial contribution to the growing body of literature on special education and universal design. It looks at the design of physical and technological environments at institutions of higher education; at issues pertaining to curriculum and instruction; and at the full array of student services. It concludes with a thorough consideration of how to institutionalize universal design at higher education institutions.","2008","2024-09-24 17:53:59","2024-09-24 17:53:59","","","308","","","","","","","","","","Harvard Education Press","Cambridge, Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","College buildings–Barrier-free design–United States; College students with disabilities–Education–United States; College students with disabilities–Services for–United States; Inclusive education; People with disabilities–Education (Higher)–United States; People with disabilities–Services for–United States; Students with disabilities–Services for–United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although having separate staffs, catalogs, and collections, the libraries share a single reference/information desk. The reference staffs work together to serve a very diverse clientele including students, faculty, engineers, scientists, contractors, regulators, and the public. The combined libraries offer significant benefits to both library staffs and their users.

As organizational charts flatten increased levels of responsibility are expected of employees. These changes require libraries to increase the leadership skills of the talented librarians and staff members already working at their libraries. This paper describes a collaborative project between the University of Houston Libraries Training Committee and the University of Houston Human Resources Department (HR) in which emerging leaders within the library attended a semester-long intensive program designed to nurture Excellence in Library Leadership (ELLP). Successful applicants to the University of Houston Libraries ELLP participated in personality and emotional intelligence assessments; attended six interactive day-long sessions with content specifically tailored to leadership skills in the library setting; and formed a cohort that has been active in planning and advocating for continued leadership and emotional intelligence training within the organization. This paper discusses the content of the program, the lessons learned from two cohorts, information about how other libraries might pilot a similar program, and a description of how the ELLP is impacting UH Libraries' culture.

For years, national college and university library organizations have actively promoted the creation of IL programs. At the University at Albany (UA), the development of an IL program was initiated in 2000; and in the fall of that year, the first IL-approved courses were taught. Librarians at the UA's University Library observed an increase in student transactions at the reference desk after the start of the IL classes. Over the next several semesters this trend continued. This is not surprising since these courses required the extensive use of library materials and resources-including books, reference resources, periodicals, government documents, and subscription research databases. To explore the increased reference activity, the researchers initiated this study to review patterns of University Library reference desk statistics as well as to conduct a survey to determine how students in IL-approved courses used reference services and resources. The IL program at UA was instituted in response to a 1998 resolution passed by the State University of New York Board of Trustees.","2005","2024-09-24 17:53:59","2024-09-24 17:53:59","","353-370","","3","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","INFORMATION literacy; ACADEMIC libraries; UNIVERSITIES & colleges; Information science; GOVERNMENT publications; LIBRARY materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Findings are based on results from an online survey distributed to all full-time faculty (1,451 in total) with a response rate of 15.2%. The value of this paper lies first in its contribution to a field of enquiry where a research deficit has been identified especially in terms of survey-based studies that have been conducted in the last five years and qualitative research studies, in general. In other words few studies in the library literature investigate faculty perceptions and experiences of IL. Second, it contributes to IL research and practice by both synthesising and corroborating some of the findings of earlier studies of a similar nature and establishes that many faculty attitudes and practices regarding IL instruction have remained relatively constant over time. They show evidence of a strong and enduring faculty belief in the value of solid student IL proficiencies; concerns that these competencies fall below desired standards; the view that IL instruction is beneficial; and evidence of disconnections between expressed beliefs and actual IL practice. Third, this study builds on what is already known by uncovering disciplinary differences in faculty opinions and practices in the domain of IL instruction and by providing insights on how perceptions and rankings of different types of IL competencies among faculty are evolving and changing in an increasingly web-based information universe.

The qualitative research study reported in this article involved 7 focus groups of students with disabilities (a total of 24 students) and 12 focus groups of postsecondary faculty members and administrators (a total of 41 participants) on campuses nationwide. The purpose of the research was to identify content, media, and formats for faculty development. Results suggest that campuses offer training that increases faculty knowledge regarding disabilities and legal issues, and knowledge and skills related to accommodation strategies (especially for learning disabilities and other ""invisible"" disabilities) that maintain academic standards, communication between students and faculty, confidentiality, resources, and service coordination. A variety of training options should be offered to address the wide range of faculty interests. These may include short presentations as part of existing meetings, longer seminars, participatory workshops with case studies, online training, searchable Web resources, video presentations, and short printed materials. The authors share how applying the principles of universal design offers a promising practice for organizing content for and delivering training to instructors and how the results of this study were applied in a nationwide faculty training program.

A medium-sized academic library is one affiliated with a bachelor's degree granting institution where the FTE enrollment is 3,000-9,999. Libraries reported their type of service model, number of questions asked, number of staff, variety of service points, types of staff utilized, hours and other factors used to make staffing decisions. What are the staffing practices in reference departments at medium-sized academic libraries? How many reference and non-reference librarians are scheduled to work at reference service points? How many questions are typically asked during a week? Are students or support staff utilized? What type of model is most prevalent-one central desk with one librarian, several distributed desks with one or more staff members, a tiered service model or something else? What factors do reference managers consider when determining the hours and types of staff scheduled? These questions, and more, are explored in this report.

Less attention has been paid to the potential costs of such schemes. Drawing on experience from a range of sources, this paper identifies eight consequences of publishing performance data that are not necessarily intended, and which are likely to be dysfunctional. The paper gives examples of such phenomena from the UK public sector, and suggests ways in which they can be mitigated. While not challenging the desirability of publishing performance data, the paper concludes that the performance indicator philosophy is based on inadequate models of production and control. Most performance indicator schemes will therefore fail unless serious consideration is given to the deficiencies described in this paper.

Using a survey to measure students' self-reported knowledge before and after a training module developed and conducted by librarian and faculty, this study shows the extent of learning gain with respect to students' ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the required information. Comparing to the results of a control group of students without the training, the authors adjusted for learning gain due to other activities or measurement. The findings show significant perceived as well as objective learning gain as a result of concerted team efforts in training and teaching by the librarian and discipline faculty.

The women in this study chose to combine having children with an academic career. Most of them depicted their career trajectory as a lifelong challenge, one that was both fulfilling and prestigious. In contrast, the women reported a number of obstacles in their career paths that served to prevent them from gaining full membership in academic life. This study probes the nature of such obstacles that are grouped into two categories: the child-related time crunch and the career-related time crunch. As a result of these obstacles, the women encountered childbearing/childrearing problems, research dilemmas, a willingness to leave the academy, and denial of tenure and promotion. Findings call for a restructuring of academic careers in order to effectively accommodate women with children in the profession. Cette recherche se base sur des entrevues en profondeur impliquant dix-neuf professeurs féminins de divers rangs et provenant de diverses facultés d'une université canadienne. Le but de la recherche était d'explorer les liens entre les vies privée et professionnelle de ces femmes qui ont choisi de fonder une famille tout en poursuivant leur carrière universitaire. Plusieurs de ces femmes ont décrit la trajectoire de leur carrière comme étant un long défi qu'elles considèrent prestigieux et offrant une occasion d'épanouissement personnel. Cependant, elles ont aussi decrit un certain nombre d'obstacles rencontrés dans leur cheminement et elles croient que ceux-ci les ont empéchées d'intégrer complètement une vie universitaire. Cette recherche tente d'élucider la nature de ces obstacles qui sont regroupés en deux categories: le temps dédié à élever les enfants et le temps dédié à la carrière professionnelle. Pour ces femmes, ces obstacles ont les conséquences suivantes: des difficultés concernant la maternité et celles à élever les enfants, des dilemmes en recherche et des difficultés que certaines doivent affronter lorsqu'elles quittent volontairement leur poste en se voyant ainsi refuser de l'ancienneté d'emploi ainsi que des promotions liées au poste. Les données de cette recherche démontrent qu'il est grand temps que ces inégalités soient reconnues afin d'établir des moyens plus efficaces pour admettre adéquatement des femmes avec des enfants a charge dans la profession universitaire.

In particular, the Georgia Death Penalty Assessment Team examined 12 issues: collection, preservation, and testing of DNA and other types of evidence; law enforcement identifications and interrogations; crime laboratories and medical examiner offices; prosecutorial professionalism; defense services; the direct appeal process; state postconviction proceedings; clemency; jury instructions; judicial independence; the treatment of racial and ethnic minorities; and mental retardation and mental illness. Overall, there is a need to reform a number of areas within Georgia’s death penalty system to ensure that it provides a fair and accurate system for every person who faces the death penalty. The following problem areas are in most need of reform: inadequate defense at trial, inadequate proportionality review, inadequate pattern jury instructions on mitigation, racial disparities in capital sentencing, inappropriate burden of proof for mentally retarded defendants facing the death penalty, and the possibility of the death penalty for felony murder.","2006","2024-09-24 17:53:59","2024-09-24 17:53:59","","","323","","","","","","","","","","Washington, DC: American Bar Association","","","","","","","","","","","","","Evaluation; Capital punishment; Death Penalty; Racial differences; Ethnic groups; Evaluative Studies; Law enforcement; Mental health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - The article presents results of a survey directed to leadership institute attendees and attempts to determine the impact of such institutes on librarians' careers, and their willingness to move into administrative positions (department head, director, etc.) or leadership roles (project leader, committee chair). This paper was developed from the poster session, ""Follow Me! Are Leadership Institutes Creating the Next Generation of Library Leaders?"" presented at the American Library Association's Annual Conference in Washington, DC, June 24, 2007. Survey questions allowed data collection on the nature and impact of the leadership institute experience, attendees' supervisory and administrative experience, and their future professional goals. The role of leadership mentors and the potential of mentorship to increase the number of library leaders was also considered. Findings - Librarians who attended leadership institutes felt it had a direct impact on their careers because they are more willing to move into leadership, management, and administrative roles. The majority of attendees find their leadership institute experience professionally valuable and would recommend it to others. Additionally, survey findings reveal the importance of professional mentors. Research limitations/implications - The survey was limited to librarians who attended a leadership institute. Approximately 75 percent of respondents were female, with only 25 percent male, which reflects the general demographics of the profession as a whole. Practical implications - Leadership institutes should be developed to focus on particular constituencies. A variety of formats - retreats, year-long - will also help address different needs among potential attendees. Current library and institutional administrators should encourage librarians to develop their leadership potential. Originality/value - This paper addresses the insufficient number of librarians both willing and prepared to take on leadership roles both within individual libraries and the profession at large, which is a growing concern to the library profession.

A survey was sent to academic libraries asking about the number of reference desks in the library building, the number of questions asked at the reference desk, the staffing of the desk, and the use of non-degreed library employees at the reference desk. Particular focus is given to the use of reference staffing by library employees who do not hold a Masters degree in Library and Information Science.","0000","2024-09-24 17:53:59","2024-09-24 17:53:59","","54-59","","1","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACADEMIC libraries – Reference services; Library administration; REFERENCE librarians; REFERENCE services (Libraries); Library employees; ACADEMIC libraries – Use studies; ACADEMIC libraries – Effect of technological innovations on; Academic; DEGREES; INFORMATION behavior; INFORMATION-seeking strategies; LIBRARIES & the Internet; LIBRARY surveys","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - The author examined quantitative and qualitative reference use data prior to changing the service model, and the purpose of reference services was formally articulated. Following the change the author again examined use data, conducted a convenience sample survey, and measured visits to the web site. Findings - The author came to the conclusion that while maintaining in-person reference was important for the library, a separate desk was not the best means of providing service at the college. Following the change to the service model, use of reference and consultation services dramatically increased. Originality/value - The new on-call, consultative reference service model is described, as is a description of how they managed the change process internally, how they marketed reference services to the students, and how they are assessing the results. Considerations for choosing a reference model appropriate to one's local conditions are outlined.

Due to new initiatives at the University of New Mexico, reference services are flourishing even though traditional desk reference interactions are declining. Incorporating more engaged librarians within the academic and surrounding communities has expanded reference services and created new opportunities for librarians to consult with users in multiple settings. The establishment of a virtual service desk has increased the accessibility and visibility of the library to 'meet users where they are' in an electronic environment.

In this article, I draw on personal experience and scholarly debate to demonstrate that while many academic institutions have made considerable progress in accommodating academic parents' practical concerns—i.e., accessibility to quality childcare and reduced time for teaching and research—they still fail to recognize how thoroughly motherhood can alter a female academic's career. I argue that the psychological adjustment to motherhood required of female academics who bear children early in their careers calls for serious reconsideration of the timing and requirements associated with the tenure process. In response to this psychological and emotional consideration, I suggest a triplet of modifications to the standard research-driven tenure model intended to emphasize individual academics' experiences and interests, in general, and the ways in which the experiences of academic mothers, in particular, might positively transform academe.

In order to investigate the conversion decisions of Dutch arable farms, a discrete stochastic dynamic utility-efficient programming (DUEP) model is developed with special attention for yield and price risk of conventional, conversion and organic crops. The model maximizes the expected utility of the farmer depending on the farmer's risk attitude. The DUEP model is an extension of a dynamic linear programming model that maximized the labour income of conversion from conventional to organic farming over a 10 year planning horizon. The DUEP model was used to model a typical farm for the central clay region in the Netherlands. The results show that for a risk-neutral farmer it is optimal to convert to organic farming. However, for a more risk-averse farmer it is only optimal to fully convert if policy incentives are applied such as taxes on pesticides or subsidies on conversion, or if the market for the organic products becomes more stable.","2009","2024-09-24 17:53:59","2024-09-24 17:53:59","","393-411","","3","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural Extension Services Q160; Agricultural R&D; Agricultural Technology; and Farm Input Markets Q120; Farm Households; Micro Analysis of Farm Firms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients with HIH may present during the neonatal period, infancy, or childhood and may show transient, prolonged, and persistent features. In this study, we aimed to discuss our experience with HIH patients, based on a series of 17 patients.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory characteristics at the time of diagnosis and during treatment and evaluated the neurodevelopmental outcomes during follow-up in 17 HIH patients, who presented or were referred to the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic of Dr. Sami Ulus Training and Research Children's Hospital between 1998 and 2011. The patients (7 male, 10 female) were aged between the first day of life and 7 years - 10 were in their first week of life, 6 in their infancy, and 1 in childhood.Results: None of the mothers had gestational diabetes. Hypoglycemic seizure (76.5%) was the most common presenting symptom. Medical treatment failed in two patients, and was stopped in eight patients. Of two diazoxide-unresponsive patients, one underwent near-total pancreatectomy, but hypoglycaemic episodes continued after surgery. The parents of other patient refused surgery, the medical treatment was continued, nevertheless, severe motor and mental retardation developed. At follow-up, 23.5% of the patients were found to have mild or moderate psychomotor retardation, and 23.5% developed epilepsy. There was no marked difference in neurological results between cases with onset in the neonatal period or in infancy.Conclusions: Clinical course and treatment response in HIH cases are very heterogeneous. Long-term careful monitoring is needed to detect and treat the complications.","2013-09-10","2024-09-24 17:53:59","2024-09-24 17:53:59","","150-155","","3","5","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"RSXFHESH","journalArticle","2015","","Why Do We Need to Bother?: Public Library Services for LGBTQI People","Library Trends","","","","","In considering social justice, many commentators overlook (or disregard) the needs of people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer/questioning, or intersex (LGBTQI), assuming, for example, that they do not require any particular support or recognition, or that they “self-exclude” by “choosing” to be LGBTQI. This article aims to challenge these perceptions. Young (and not-so-young) people may find it easier to come out today—and, indeed, the necessity to have life framed by coming-out stories may be fading. Nevertheless, we know that many people still struggle and still have to face hostility, threats, even violence. Suicide rates among young LGBTQI people, often the result of bullying, are unacceptably high. The cultural sector, including public libraries, can play a huge part in combating prejudice by providing safe, informed (and informative) spaces where people can explore who they are, and be who they are as well. However, not all public libraries understand this, or want to play this role. This article identifies some of the needs and demands of LGBTQI people, demonstrates the good practice that public libraries have developed, and examines gaps where this is not happening. The focus will be primarily on public libraries’ work in the UK. It looks at some of the key background issues (prejudice against LGBTQI people, for example), then focuses on the ways in which the public library can intervene, concluding with practical examples of the range of work that is being undertaken and some suggestions of what still needs to be done.","2015","2024-09-24 17:53:59","2024-09-24 17:53:59","","285-298","","2","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Libraries – Social Aspects – Great Britain; Libraries And Sexual Minorities – Great Britain; Social Justice – Great Britain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What should the library profession look for in their rising managers? There are not clear answers to these questions right now. But development of a set of research-based competencies will give answers to these questions, and will give a foundation for other research-based ideas to be developed to assist manager-leaders in the library. The research objective for this study is to refine a set of competencies, identified from the literature, through the opinions of current public library directors. The development of manager/leaders in the library world is too important to be left to chance. Using a research-based set of competencies as a foundation should help in the development of training opportunities for librarians who wish to be successful in their positions as directors.

Design/methodology/approach – A consultant was engaged to facilitate a review of the UOW Library's leadership situation. Key to this process and subsequent activities was the use of the Lominger Leadership competencies; measurable characteristics related to success in the workplace to establish the desired leadership profile. Career interviews, professional coaching and targeted assignments were integral to the development of needed competencies. Findings – The paper finds that feedback from peers, managers and staff was a significant component of the evaluation strategy. Formal assessment took place through the use of the Lominger's VOICES® 360-degree feedback instrument, an institutional employee climate survey and recertification against the Investors in People standard. Results showed improved self-confidence in leaders, a greater preparedness to address underperformance, and that career and developmental plans were more considered and constructive in their design. Significant improvement in leadership performance was noted in a later employee climate survey. Practical implications – A commitment by the executive or senior leadership team is critical to this type of developmental program. Considerable energy and time is required from all parties involved, e.g. scheduling time for workshops, coaching sessions, subsequent actions and review; challenging in an environment of ever-increasing priorities. Challenging also is the management of perceptions and expectations of staff. There was some disaffection from staff who were not included in the first round of coaching. Subsequently, opportunities to support both external and internal coaching are being investigated. Originality/value – A commitment to new methods to support and evaluate leadership development initiatives resulted in changed perceptions of leadership aspiration, aptitude and ability. The identification of required competencies provided improved goal clarity, insight on how to become skilled in a given competency, and a reference point for evaluation. Importantly the performance of leaders has improved. There is qualitative and quantitative data to demonstrate both a commitment to leadership development and the application of desired behaviours associated with the competencies. The capacity to grow and promote from within has also improved; evidence that the succession management initiative is being achieved.

Design/methodology/approach – A study was undertaken to assess incoming international students' exposure to libraries, computer literacy skills, and to determine their library needs. Results from a survey conducted in August 2003 include demographic information about incoming students, computer and library use before coming to the US, library concepts that are new to them, and opinions about the library. Findings – Survey results show that international students arrive in the US with high levels of computer literacy and that most incoming students have used a library in their home country. Findings suggest that international students would benefit from specialized library information competence and orientation programs. Research limitations/implications – This study was conducted just over 3 weeks after the Dr Martin Luther King, Jr Library opened its doors. Thus, student survey responses were collected during an unsettled period. While students perceive themselves as understanding library terminology, no testing was conducted to confirm this. Further study is needed to determine the extent of their knowledge of library terms and jargon. Practical implications - Survey results have led to the implementation of library programs that support the information competence, retention and academic success of international students. Originality/value – Few studies include the international students themselves to determine their library and educational needs. This study offers a current view of the library needs of international students as they perceive them.

One challenge has been ensuring adequate access to the general education curriculum for an increasingly diverse group of learners within general education classrooms. One approach to making general education curriculum more accessible to diverse learners regardless of ability, learning style, language, or culture is the application of Universal Design for Learning (UDL). Grounded in research of learner differences, the capacities of new media, and the most effective teaching practices and assessments, UDL provides a framework for creating more robust learning opportunities for everyone. By using a UDL approach in the classroom, teachers design their instruction to meet the needs of a diverse group of learners rather than make ongoing adjustments for individual students with special needs. Highlighting the importance of UDL as a fundamental instructional approach has the potential to benefit students and teachers in both general and special education programs. In this article, the authors review the historical background regarding the movement toward greater access for students with special learning needs, the development of UDL as a method for providing access, and discuss supporting the implementation of UDL within school sites and institutions of higher education.

(b) What was the discourse of leadership in the profession surrounding the development of the Core Competences? (c) How might this competence affect LIS education? And what measures, if any, have MLIS programs taken to address it? Informants involved in the development of the Core Competences indicated that leadership was added because it is an important issue for LIS professionals and it links ""transformational"" to professional change; however, they were unable to provide a clear explanation for the descriptor ""principled."" Discursively, leadership is strongly tied to discourses of management, change, and youth. Preparing leaders is a stated goal of most ALA-accredited LIS programs; however, the discourse on leadership within the profession indicates that schools of LIS may be paying more attention to leadership within their curricula, specifically in management classes.

In Study 1, the instructional climate for students with disabilities was assessed through a survey of 271 faculty members and teaching associates (TAs) and focus groups with 92 additional faculty members and TAs. Survey respondents ranked universal design for learning (UDL) as the most needed training topic. A web-based, self-paced professional development tool called FAME (Faculty and Administrator Modules in Higher Education) was developed, piloted, and revised in response to the training needs identified. In Study 2, a review of FAME by 98 faculty members and administrators supported the value of on-demand, multi-modal professional development in universal design. Ninety-two percent of respondents reported increased comfort in meeting the instructional needs of students with disabilities as a result of using this curriculum. Implications and specific guidelines for providing educational access to students with disabilities are discussed.","2008","2024-09-24 17:54:00","2024-09-24 17:54:00","","60-72","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Postsecondary education; Access to Education; College Faculty; Special Needs Students; College Students; Disabilities; Professional Development; SURVEYS; Focus Groups; Administrators; Educational Needs; Enrollment; National Longitudinal Transition Study Spec Educ; Nontraditional Students; Web Based Instruction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper questions the extent to which the students' lack of business exposure is perceived by teachers as a barrier to effective learning and teaching. It suggests that learning and teaching would be enhanced for all stakeholders if students experienced the real-life complexities of actual organisations either before, or in the early part, of their degree programmes. This would serve the dual purpose of allowing the students to better comprehend the taught content as it relates to real life, while continuing to enhance their eventual employability in the same way that many existing placement schemes aim to do.","2009","2024-09-24 17:54:00","2024-09-24 17:54:00","","41-50","","1","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Teaching Methods; Undergraduate Students; Experiential Learning; Business Administration Education; Australia; Foreign Countries; Barriers; Comprehension; New Zealand; Prior Learning; Work Experience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"CP3NAS7F","journalArticle","2009","Haglund, Lotta","Reference Services in Australian Academic Libraries are Becoming More Multifaceted","Evidence Based Library & Information Practice","","","","http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lxh&AN=45546524&site=ehost-live&scope=site","Objective -To investigate the current organizational models for reference work in Australian academic libraries, and how these reference services are staffed. Design - Mixed methods. Setting - Academic universities in Australia. Subjects - Forty Council of Australian University Librarians (CAUL) member libraries. Methods - A literature study was undertaken to (1) find a definition of reference services and find a definition of reference services and (2) explore the development of reference service models over time. Statistics from the CAUL member libraries were studied for trends in student population and number of academic and library staff. A web-based survey, with questions based on the findings in the literature study, was then distributed to the 40 Australian university libraries in 2006. Respondents were asked when the library commenced different reference services in five areas: formats in which the library received and responded to reference queries, information literacy, subject specialization, liaison activities, and collection development. Respondents also answered questions about the organization of the reference department, including: whether they had a separate or integrated model; the size of the reference collections; if they had a librarian dedicated to supporting students studying in remote or distant mode; if the interlibrary loans department was part of the suite of reference services; and if they had a mission or statement of purpose for their reference services department. Main Results - Based on the literature study, the working definition of reference services (1) for the project was ""all activities which assist in providing relevant and appropriate information services to patrons"" (270), including: • All interactions with patrons to assist them in their searches for information in all media types. • All training by librarians of patrons to be able to access information for themselves. • Activities to help the library stay informed of relevant developments, such as establishing and maintaining relationships with patrons. The literature study also revealed (2) a shift from the traditional reference service model, focused on the reference desk and the services delivered from that location, to new models involving ""consolidation of reference service points, establishment of tiered reference, reference by appointment, reorganization of reference departments, and limiting services to primary users"" (271). The core aspects of reference services have changed little over time, including face-to-face reference work, print collection development, bibliographic instruction, and attending meetings. In some aspects, however, there has been a shift in emphasis, e.g., in bibliographic instruction from the teaching of tools to the teaching of information literacy. In addition, reference work has come to include ""going out to users,"" or academic liaison work, as well as research consultation as a general way to assist undergraduate student in getting started on assignments and projects. The Web-based survey (n=40, response rate 87.5%) showed that 32.4% of libraries have an integrated inquiry point which incorporates information queries and other queries that are not necessarily related to traditional library reference services (272, Table 1). This survey result supports the findings of the literature study in showing a trend of library services moving away from the traditional reference desk. A majority of the responding libraries still retained a separate reference department, but a significant number of libraries have developed departments incorporating reference services with other library services. Those that retained the separate department varied in how they described services to patrons, the most common name being Information Services, a more user-friendly and descriptive name.… [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]; Copyright of Evidence Based Library & Information Practice is the property of University of Alberta, Learning Services and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Here the effects of intact crude whey, intact individual whey proteins and beta-lactoglobulin hydrolysates on an enteroendocrine (EE) cell model were examined. STC-1 pGIP/neo cells were incubated with several concentrations of yogurt whey (YW), cheese whey (CW), beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), alpha-lactalbumin (ALA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA). The findings demonstrate that BLG stimulates EE cell proliferation, and also GLP-1 secretion (an effect which is lost following hydrolysis with chymotrypsin or trypsin). ALA is a highly potent GLP-1 secretagogue which also increases the intracellular levels of GLP-1. Conversely, whey proteins and hydrolysates had little impact on GIP secretion. This appears to be the first investigation of the effects of the three major proteins of YW and CW on EE cells. The anti-diabetic potential of whey proteins should be further investigated.

In conjunction with student support services there are two professional development emphases for instructional faculty that contribute to the institutional support needed by college students with disabilities. Students benefit when faculty have an increased awareness and knowledge of the characteristics and needs of students with disabilities and when faculty incorporate concepts of universal design into their instruction and curriculum.

Using the theory of clubs, this paper examines the possibility of co-existence for GM and organic wheat technologies through the formation of an organic club with an endogenously determined buffer zone. Given the available data on prices, and yields, it is shown that a club can be created in which GM and organic agricultural production technologies can economically co-exist in the same physical landscape. Specifically, co-existence results in an increase in economic welfare over a situation where only GM technology is used but is not Pareto superior because producers in the buffer zone will incur injury. We show that organic producers in the club can compensate producers in the buffer zone and still be better off. Hence, the compensation principle holds.","2007","2024-09-24 17:54:00","2024-09-24 17:54:00","","185-195","","2","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural Extension Services Q160; Agricultural R&D; Agricultural Technology; Agribusiness Q130; Agricultural Markets and Marketing; Associations D710; Clubs; Committees; Cooperatives; Social Choice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Universal design for learning offers theory and practice principles for designing learning environments and materials where supports are embedded to support learning for all students. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce administrators to the principles of universal design (UD) for learning. The goal is to explain how UD principles can be implemented using technology, in ways that will explicitly target the special needs of learners with disabilities, but will offer educational benefit to all students. The value of this approach is that busy administrators will be able to articulate a clear philosophy regarding the alignment of technology in postsecondary education and improved student outcomes; ""check point"" questions at the end of each subsection can further assist in clarifying individual and campus philosophies. On a practical level, readers will learn about resources, strategies, and tools that will support faculty and students in building academic success.

The critical success factors of every change project are information, communication and participation. Two qualitative studies concerning leadership in academic libraries and leadership in academic and public libraries in times of change, as well as a quantitative study in an academic library concerning the influence of a transformational and a transactional leadership style of the top management on the middle management as well as on team members including the influence of the organizational culture, emphasize the importance of these success factors, especially the communication competence of leaders in times of change.

Design/methodology/approach – This is a conceptual paper that examines the potential application of a business change model to an academic library change context. Each step of Kotter's model is described within the context of building a culture of assessment, supported by examples and suggestions from the literature of libraries, higher education, organizational behavior and change leadership. Findings – While building a culture of assessment is critical for libraries in the current environment, it is a difficult and complex process that requires grassroots initiative, top-down support and strong leadership. Kotter's model for change management provides a pragmatic structure for culture change through behavioral change and change leadership regardless of positional authority. Practical implications – This paper includes best practices for facilitating a culture of assessment, including necessary resources and possible approaches. Originality/value – While the literature contains articles about building a culture of assessment, no studies have applied models of change leadership from the management literature to this unique cultural process. This is the first paper that suggests concrete steps for libraries towards building a culture of assessment, even in the absence of an ideal organizational culture. The focus is also on enabling change leadership regardless of whether the change agents have positional authority.

Design/methodology/approach - Set within a backdrop of budget cuts, severe time and staffing limitations, and increasing demands for library services, the paper assesses the processes and results of implementing this new model of peer reference at a medium-sized academic library. Findings - The findings suggest that undergraduate students are not only capable but perhaps optimal at providing high-quality reference service to their peers. Originality/value - This paper redefines the peer reference model, using a case study carried out in a US university library.

Specifically, the potential influence of student demographics, learning environment factors, and information literacy program components on behavioral, psychological, and benefit outcomes were examined. In total, 79 interviews with library administrators, librarians, teaching faculty, and students were conducted at three business schools with varying ILI emphases and characteristics. During these interviews, participants discussed students' ILI experiences and the outcomes arising from those experiences. Data collection also involved application of a standardized information literacy testing instrument that measures student information literacy competency. Analysis yielded the generation of a new holistic theoretical model based on information literacy and educational assessment theories. The model identifies potential salient factors of the learning environment, information literacy program components, and student demographics that may affect ILI student learning outcomes. Recommendations for practice and implications for future research are also made.

Design/methodology/approach - Students were surveyed regarding the types of business course assignments that require research and the number of sources which must be cited for these research projects. The information-seeking behaviors of business students used in gathering these sources were examined, looking at where these students began their research, which tools they used, and the challenges they faced in conducting research. The paper also investigated the students' preferred methods of seeking assistance in completing their research, as well as how they evaluated the credibility of sources they uncovered. Findings - Student research requirements for homework assignments were fairly evenly distributed between very often/often and sometimes/never. Overall, students noted that presentations required research very often or often. Only 2.35 percent reported no research for short papers, with graduate students representing the largest group who indicated no research required for short papers. By contrast, 81 percent of seniors responded that they conducted research for short papers either very often or often. When preparing long papers (over six pages), students most frequently reported that research requirements were required sometimes. During the qualitative phase of the project, students revealed their frustration with doing research on very specific topics assigned by professors. Originality/value - The results of this research can assist librarians in two important areas: collection management and instruction.

The patrons perceived the quality of reference service for government publications declining from 'very good' to 'good.' The data collected indicate a strong decline in the quantity of documents usage and a slight decline in the quality of reference service for government publications. This seems to show that the patrons of a library such as the Iowa State University Library will make more use of government publications that are serviced at a separate reference desk than they do when they are serviced at a general reference desk.","1989","2024-09-24 17:54:00","2024-09-24 17:54:00","","247-257","","3","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","REFERENCE services (Libraries); Studies; Government documents; Federal government","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Classification between T1D and type 2 diabetes becomes more challenging with increasing age of onset of T1D over time develops in genetically predisposed individuals. The main susceptibility is conferred with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Some of the geographic variation in incidence and familial aggregation is explained by differences in HLA haplotypes. In many populations, the incidence is somewhat higher in males than in females, and a 1.3- to 2.0-fold male excess in incidence after about 15 years of age exists in most populations. The incidence of childhood-onset T1D varies markedly among countries. East Asian and native American populations have low incidences (approximately 0.1-8 per 100 000/year), while the highest rates are found in Finland (>60 per 100 000/year), Sardinia (40 per 100 000/year), and Sweden (47 per 100 000/year). The risk is highest in European-derived populations. About 10 %-20 % of newly diagnosed childhood cases of T1D have an affected first-degree relative. Those with an affected sibling or parent have a cumulative risk of 3 %-7 % up to about 20 years of age, as compared with <1 % in the general population. The cumulative incidence among the monozygotic co-twins of persons with T1D is less than 50 %. Thus, the majority of genetically predisposed people do not develop T1D. Studies assessing temporal trends have shown that the incidence of childhood-onset T1D has increased in all parts of the world. The average relative increase is 3 %-4 % per calendar year. For instance, in Finland, the incidence today is 5 times higher than 60 years ago. At the same time, the age at onset of T1D in children has become younger. It is strongly believed that nongenetic factors are important for the development of T1D and its increase, but the causative evidence is missing. The causes for this increasing trend and current epidemic still remain unknown.","2013-09-27","2024-09-24 17:54:01","2024-09-24 17:54:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ENG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was conducted in the most progressive hilly state of India, namely, Himachal Pradesh for a period of five years during 1998-99 through 2002-03. The comparative economics of OFS vis-a-vis IFS is clearly in favour of OFS which is also necessary for sustainable agriculture. The Inorganic Farming System (IFS) has made agriculture costly, risky, economically unviable and ecologically unsustainable. On the other hand, the Organic Farming System (OFS) has proved to be an effective cure for the ills and problems of IFS as it puts life into the soil through the addition of organic manure and promoting the activities of soil micro-organisms, improves soil structure, soil health and soil productivity to increase yields, production, income and profits of crops on sustainable basis. The potential of organic farming is very vast. The study recommends that the Government of India should set up an Organic Agricultural Research Institute (OARI) with its all India network and centers in different states. The proposed OARI should conduct research and provide extension services, training, extension skills, education, etc., with respect to organic farming, OFS, agro-ecosystem, biodiversity, methods of making improved FYM, compost, vermiculture, biological control of harmful insects and others pests, protected cultivation under polyhouses, site-specific technologies for precision organic farming management, processing and marketing to compete in the world markets for producing enough at low-cost in agriculture.","2005-04","2024-09-24 17:54:01","2024-09-24 17:54:01","","205-219","","2","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural Extension Services Q160; Agricultural R&D; Agricultural Technology; and Farm Input Markets Q120; Farm Households; Micro Analysis of Farm Firms; Agribusiness Q130; Agricultural Markets and Marketing; Cooperatives; Economic Development: Agriculture; Energy; Environment; Natural Resources; Other Primary Products O130","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This practice will provide more time for librarians to devote to more advanced reference queries, instruction, collaboration, outreach, and collection development. Design/methodology/approach — The approach to determining the value of time spent training student assistants included a literature review, surveys of librarians and staff from a variety of academic libraries, and group discussions at three conferences. Findings — The literature review conducted prior to the collection of survey data showed fairly consistent opinions regarding the value of student assistants working at the reference desk. The survey data collected in the study showed that the majority of librarians have a favorable opinion of the ability of student assistants, when well trained, to answer basic reference questions. Research limitations/implications — The survey used for this study is designed to gauge opinions and attitudes from librarians and library staff. Questions included in the survey are primarily demographic or open-ended. The survey is distributed using a variety of e-mail lists and social networking tools. In total, 90 survey responses are received, and a larger sample size may be preferable to more long-term, in-depth study of this topic. Originality/value — The study summarizes and further contributes to the existing body of research about student workers in academic libraries. Readers will find a summation of training methods, core competencies, and best practices to help them to fully utilize student workers in new ways.

Commons evolved out of the “library as a place” movement and stem from the digital revolution, increased emphasis on collaborative learning, and changing student habits and needs. The three levels of commons are information commons, learning commons, and the emerging virtual commons. Libraries implementing commons must consider the impact on reference services and staffing and be prepared for higher than anticipated use. Libraries should use both quantitative and qualitative assessment methods. Commons can revitalize the library by giving it a key role in reaching university strategic goals.

There is a tendency to focus on measurement, but that ignores the way quality needs to be judged in the public realm. The assessment of performance, when values can conflict, is necessarily a matter of judgement. The assessment of performance will shift as political debate develops. Fully satisfactory measures of performance are unlikely ever to be discovered. There is a need to recognize the imperfections and limitations of measures, and to use them as a means of supporting politically informed judgement.

These design teams were required to develop “before and after” plans for key areas in their facility, to evaluate the facility for compliance or noncompliance with the intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and to indicate appropriate design solutions. Furthermore, interviews were conducted with a minimum of two occupants or users of each assigned facility, and each team's conclusions were summarized in a written report.

Residence halls, however, have received little attention as an outreach venue despite the fact that most universities stress the importance of housing's educational mission. In the three years that University of Oklahoma librarian Karen Antell lived as Faculty-in-Residence, she developed extensive library and educational programming for the students in her residence hall. These experiences formed the basis of a successful continuing outreach program to students in university housing even after Antell was no longer living in the dormitory. This article describes these programs and places them in the context of other institutions' outreach efforts, identifying factors necessary for successful library outreach to residence halls.

Students with disabilities are one of the at-risk groups whose interest in pursuing STEM careers is frequently compromised by systemic barriers to participation. Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) is a national peer mentoring model designed to promote student success in STEM courses. The authors found that students with disabilities did not benefit from PLTL as much as students without disabilities. With support from a National Science Foundation grant, the authors adapted the PLTL model by incorporating the Principles of Universal Design for Instruction (UDI) into the peer mentors' training.

Performance indicators (PIs) are therefore being developed in the absence of any proper idea about the nature of the performance they are intended to indicate. The article concludes that it is unlikely that a consensus will emerge as to how performance in the public sector should be interpreted, and that evaluation therefore depends on the objectives of the individual undertaking the analysis. So the proper role of PIs should be to inform political debate, and more attention should be given to the democratic institutions that allow that debate to take place.

While the concept of Universal Design originated with the needs of students with disabilities, its value and application extend to a much wider student constituency. The concepts within Universal Design can be used to communicate information crucial for a wide range of students with specific needs who are considering study abroad programs, in order for them to assess access possibilities. This article outlines concepts and suggests an assessment survey that can assist institutions in considering the diversity of needs of students and, thereby, identifying in advance appropriate accommodations to help ensure the health and safety of program participants. The authors provide study abroad programs with a new and innovative way to create a more responsive overseas context for the growing range of students studying abroad. By utilizing the Access Assessment Survey to consider ways to meet the needs of students with various functional differences, U.S. institutions and overseas providers can identify the program modifications and design changes required to benefit a variety of student learning and living needs.

A total of 143 international business students on campus volunteered to fill out a survey. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics as well as inferential statistics such as t-tests and correlation. A significant portion of international business students has no prior experience with electronic library services in their home countries. Moreover, about a half of international business students go to libraries other than the Business and Economics Library, partly because they provide better environment for study. Although electronic resources are available without the constraint of location, providing reference services for those who do not use the Business and Economics Library becomes a challenge. Virtual reference is an excellent tool, but most international business students do not see it as an important library service. Based on the results, implications for information literacy and virtual reference service are discussed.

The ability to turn this challenge into a workable and effective function lies with the scheduler and indirectly the cooperation of all librarians scheduled for reference desk service. It is the scheduler's sensitivity to such factors as dealing with human nature that each librarian brings to the reference desk. There are certain dynamics at play between librarians and patrons. Combining these dynamics with the components for the reference desk schedule, adding management techniques for conflict resolution, evolves into an effective reference desk schedule beneficial to the patrons and librarians.

However, the use of individualized accommodations as the sole method for resolving access barriers in the classroom is neither sustainable nor equitable. Furthermore, this somewhat flawed methodology creates systemic barriers, places the locus of control in the disability resource office, and reinforces stereotypical thinking about disability. An evaluation and redesign of course material by faculty may decrease the need for retrofit accommodations, create a community environment of empowerment, and change the nature of the relationship between faculty, students with disabilities, and disability resource center professionals. This practice brief details the results of a collaboration between a faculty member and a disability resource professional on course design to create sustainable, equitable, and just learning environments at Western Illinois University, a Midwestern comprehensive university.

These RLOs have helped to facilitate student transition from second to third level, advance IL and enrich the student learning experience. The purpose of this paper is to outline the development of these RLOs and how the resources have been shared, reused and repurposed to enhance IL progression. A review of recent literature explores some of the key issues around the creation of digital learning resources and best practice, as well as the pedagogical foundations on which the learning objects are built. The design, development and implementation of the RLOs and the collaborative working arrangements that the digital resources have helped to foster are also outlined and the authors examine the issues and challenges experienced by the project team during the course of the RLO development. The significant usage and substantial impact that the learning objects have had on student-centred education and the various evaluative mechanisms used to measure the effectiveness of the RLOs is discussed, as well as future development plans. These learning tools have promoted best practice in innovative delivery methods and added value to the wider higher education (HE) community in the Republic of Ireland through their sharing, dissemination and reuse as open educational resources (OERs) via the National Digital Learning Resources (NDLR) service. The paper is likely to be of particular relevance to academic library practitioners and teaching staff in Irish HE as it provides an overview and links to a suite of digital learning tools that can be used or adapted in other academic settings. In terms of originality, there is no evidence of any published literature within the context of Irish HE sector covering the development of RLOs to support IL initiatives and will inform future research on how learning objects can be used to support learning and teaching practice both in the Republic of Ireland and further afield.

A number of leader and leadership development programs have emerged in Australia, Canada and the United States that attract interested participants, yet what is the core purpose of these programs? Do they work? Review of leadership programs reveals that systematic and ongoing evaluation is not only missing as a key factor for determining effectiveness but evaluation is challenging at best, as few programs have stated goals and objectives that enable evaluation. This paper reviews current research literature of leadership development programs in Business and in Library and Information Science, including program foundations, characteristics unique to librarianship and program evaluation, to determine if there are key indicators for successful programs and their evaluation. The resulting findings may guide the revision of current programs and lead to the development of new programs that ensure that current gaps in the pool of emergent leaders are bridged, in part, by improved leadership programs and institutes.

The article explains the roots of UDL in cognitive neuroscience, and the three principles of UDL: multiple means of representing information, multiple means of expressing knowledge, and multiple means of engagement in learning. The authors also examine the ways UDL has influenced their course goals and objectives, media and materials, teaching methods, and assessment techniques, including discussion groups, lectures, textbooks, and the course website. The authors emphasize the ongoing developmental nature of the course and UDL principles as tools or guidelines for postsecondary faculty, rather than a set of definitive rules. UDL is proposed as a way to address diversity and disabilities as constructs of individuals and their environment in higher education classrooms.

Most research into international students' experience of academic libraries has hitherto focussed on satisfaction ratings or the cultural and language issues experienced with academic libraries. In 2006 the La Trobe University Library conducted a survey to discover international students' preferences regarding library services and methods of communication. It also looked at how the Library could enhance their learning experiences. The survey process is described, its findings discussed, and the resulting recommendations as to how academic libraries and librarians can best service this expanding client group are presented.

However, this chapter focuses on the impact of UD on the design of facilities in a university or campus setting. Universal design has the potential for transforming universities into truly egalitarian institutions that accommodate all users regardless of their size, age, or physical capabilities, allowing them to flourish, learn, and unleash their true potential. Universities are especially good facilities for the application of UD because they accommodate a wide range of transient users. Since one size does not necessarily fit all, the application of UD needs to be appropriate to the institution's scale, facility type, and program for it to be completely effective. Universal design accommodates not only people who use wheelchairs or are blind, but also older learners, parents with children, and nontraditional learners of all sorts. The effort to provide UD can also help institutions comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and other state and local accessibility regulations. This chapter explains the differences between accessibility and UD and discusses methods of accommodation and areas of opportunity for UD on campuses.","2011","2024-09-24 17:54:01","2024-09-24 17:54:01","","13-20","","134","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Compliance (Legal); Federal Legislation; Accessibility (for Disabled); Universities; Americans with Disabilities Act 1990; Pennsylvania; Campuses; Classroom Design; College Housing; District of Columbia; Educational Facilities Design; Rehabilitation Act 1973","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this literature review was to examine existing empirical research, including qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods, on the use of UDI (and related terms) in postsecondary education. The criteria used to select articles included in this review were: (a) empirical studies in peer-reviewed journals, (b) articles published in 2000 or after, and (c) articles on the use of UDI, Universal Design for Learning (UDL), Universal Instructional Design (UID), and Universal Design (UD) in postsecondary education settings. Eight articles met the search criteria. This limited number of empirically based articles led to the conclusion that more research needs to be conducted on the use of UDI in postsecondary education. The primary recommendation for future research is to operationalize the principles of UDI and investigate its impact on the outcomes of postsecondary education students with and without disabilities.

The main goal of the study was to identify opportunities for collaboration between the university library and institutional entities that provide services to those groups. Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was utilized to gather data from students, faculty, and staff from ethnic minority groups. Electronic distribution of the instrument was augmented by in-person marketing strategies. Findings are reported in a series of tables as well as a narrative summarizing input from respondents. Findings - The results indicate that there are misconceptions about how and why students from underrepresented groups utilize library services at the University of Tennessee. The majority of patrons expressed little difficulty finding resources and information was positive and affirming of institutional efforts to improve services. Research limitations/implications - The research sample primarily consisted of students, faculty, and staff affiliated with multicultural or international student centers on the campus of the University of Tennessee, or academic programs with a related focus. Results may be generalized for institutions with similar outreach infrastructures. Practical implications - The results have been used to inform decisions regarding library outreach and services to multicultural/international constituencies on campus. Originality/value - The paper confirms the applicability of the instrument designed by Scott Walter et al., with adjustments to reflect local practice and policy. Analysis of information seeking behaviors of minority groups can help inform the development of programs and services to this constituency and identify possible collaborations between the university library and the multicultural/international student centers on campus.

When their ship, the Endurance, was caught and crushed by ice, the men were stranded on a frozen sea with no hope of rescue. Remarkably, Shackleton led his crew to safety without losing one man. He understood how to motivate people even in the most difficult conditions imaginable. His actions inspired trust, loyalty, and produced results. Using the historical method, this paper identifies the elements of Shackleton's leadership that can be adapted for use by today's leaders. This paper also explores the leadership theories that Shackleton used, including Path-Goal, Transformational, Servant, and In Extremis. The leadership techniques and concepts that Shackleton used are global in nature and can be used to improve management in any field, including libraries. Specific concepts of effective leadership, including articulation of clear goals, inspiring loyalty and trust, risk-taking, communication, morale, and knowledge of human psychology are discussed.

It is not a single charter, and is addressed more to the users of public services than to citizens as such. Born in political circumstances that appeared to demand that a new Prime Minister 'did something of his own', the Charter subsequently developed into an on-going programme that mixed together the restatement of well-established entitlements with the proclamation of new management commitments. it is too early to form a clear overall picture of the actual impact of the Charter, but there are signs that its 'value-added' varies considerably from service to service, and that there are several contexts in which charter standards have, as yet, made only a slight contribution to service quality.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss and evidence the changes and decisions facing librarians in our world against the backdrop of international disrupted business models for libraries. The traditional mode of operation for libraries is changing dramatically in order to stay relevant and connected to our library users. This paper will aim to explore future leadership styles which will be required for special librarians. This will be set in the context of the NextGen Leadership program which this author established and conducted across Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. The paper will also seek to draw on the author's experiences seeking new scenario futures for special libraries in Australia. Design/methodology/approach – This paper will explore future leadership styles which will be required for special librarians. This will be set in the context of the NextGen Leadership program which this author established and conducted across Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. It will also draw on the author's experiences seeking new scenario futures for special libraries in Australia. Findings – The evaluation of the Next Gen Leadership program is reviewed in this paper. Research limitations/implications – The implications are that librarians need programs such as Next Gen in order to be able to test new ways of adopting management behaviours. These new ways of operating can be tested through programs such as Next Gen which operate over a lengthy period of time. Practical implications – It is crucial that existing managers of academic libraries establish these leadership programs into the future as a means of ensuring good succession planning. Originality/value – This is a genuinely original program spanning three countries/cities; Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. The opportunity for participants in this course to meet, inter-mingle and network into the future with similar colleagues is unique. The opportunities to test new modes of management in such a course, remote from the work environment, are of value to the management styles of each individual into the future.

Other topics include different service models for the reference desk, the changing nature of reference questions, and changes in staffing at the reference desk. Finally, the authors speculate about the future of reference services.

This paper aims to examine, in a pragmatic way, the variations in the definition of the role of the faculty liaison librarian, the expectations of those librarians, their library managers and their clients and the impact of environmental factors. The faculty liaison librarian role is not entirely new, evolving from the traditional subject librarian and university special/branch library role. However the emerging role is characterized by a more outward-looking perspective and complexity, emphasizing stronger involvement and partnership with the faculty and direct engagement in the University's teaching and research programs. Design/methodology/approach – Following a review of the literature and other sources on the rationale and role of library liaison, the current developments, drivers and expectations are discussed. Findings – The study finds that dynamic external and internal environments of universities are driving the evolution of library liaison, so the role description is still fluid. However, the breadth and weight of expectations is now such that the effectiveness and sustainability of the role has to be addressed. Practical implications – While a dynamic, broader and more intensive role for the faculty liaison librarian is emerging, more thinking is needed about the extent of that role and its sustainability. What, for example, are the priorities for the faculty liaison librarian? What traditional activities can, and may, have to be abandoned? These considerations are necessary not only to guide the librarians, but also to help define the attributes and skills required for the position and to determine the institutional support it requires. Originality/value – This is a contemporary critique of the well-established, but diverse library service – the faculty liaison librarian structure.

Further research was needed to help the authors delve deeper and find out the story behind the data. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire was distributed to all international students in the Business School to learn about their information retrieval behaviours. The response was high but the survey was deliberately designed to only produce quantitative data, and the paper highlights the limitations of this data. More research using qualitative ethnography research techniques was needed to gather qualitative data to create a broader picture of student practice. Methods utilised included the retrospective process interview and cognitive mapping (both used by Andrew Asher in the ERIAL project). Questions from the survey were sometimes used as prompts in the qualitative process.Findings The data are still to be coded and analysed but one of the main findings is that students are unaware of the research help that they can get from their academic library.

The plagiarism issue was approached from an educational perspective, rather than a punitive. The course director and librarians developed this part of the course in close collaboration. One part of the course is dedicated to how to cite, paraphrase and reference, while another part stresses the legal and ethical aspects of research. Currently, the majority of the students are international, which means there are intercultural and language aspects to consider. In order to evaluate our approach to teaching about plagiarism, we conducted a survey. The results of the survey indicate a need for education on how to cite and reference properly in order to avoid plagiarism, a result which is also supported by students' assignment results.

Research limitations/implications – Although no survey was done for this article, much of the information gathered regarding plagiarism is dependent on external surveys. These surveys may not always be answered truthfully despite anonymity. There is also a dearth of data on plagiarism and international students. There is some anecdotal data on the subject. Practical implications – Although plagiarism is a serious problem on academic campuses, libraries and librarians can offer substantial help in deterring and preventing plagiarism especially with regard to international students. Originality/value – Librarians, knowledgeable about citation style sheets and formats, can be very valuable to international students who lack the skills. Students can learn to improve their citation skills with the help of a librarian with good bibliographic skills.

Three major library information science (LIS) databases were searched for publications meeting the study criteria, and then manual bibliography searches were performed on all those included.Findings Twenty-one of the 23 included publications were papers published in scholarly journals. There was a slight growth in number of publications by year between 1990 and 2014. Most of the research was conducted in the USA, Australia or Canada. Surveys and interviews were the most commonly used research methods, and nine of the studies used mixed methods. “Library experience” and “information seeking” emerged as the most common research topics. Key findings presented in these papers were often related to library and non-library resources, library instruction, language issues and research difficulties experienced by international students. Author recommendations were generally related to campus collaboration, staff training, assessment, cultural awareness and library instruction.Practical implications The findings of this study will be of value for LIS practitioners who wish to develop or improve information literacy training for the international student populations on their campuses.Originality/value Systematic review is a useful and rigorous method that can be of value in LIS research. This paper provides a thorough review and assessment of the original research related to international students and information literacy, and summarizes the resulting recommendations.

However, their everyday life information seeking (ELIS) behavior is seldom studied. This hinders the planning of information services and information literacy training. In light of this gap, this study surveyed 112 international students in a U.S. public university on: (1) how frequently respondents used 11 information sources; (2) how difficult it was to find information in various domains; and (3) how much their ELIS was affected by various information seeking problems. Differences between gender-study level categories and problem solving styles were tested using ANOVAs. The study found that Web search engines, social networking sites, new friends, printed resources, and traditional mass media were the top sources for ELIS. Six everyday information domains (e.g., legal, financial, and personal development information) ranked more difficult to find than academic information. Non-credible, irrelevant, and outdated information were found to be the top problems. There were more statistically significant problem solving style differences (especially on the Problem Solving Confidence subscale) than gender-study level differences. Notable gender-study level differences were still found. Male undergraduate students, for example, were more affected by their reluctance to ask personal questions. Lastly, the implications to information literacy education were discussed.

The goal of the study was to develop a student-based perspective of libraries, which can be used to improve library services and outreach. The student responses ranged from intense engagement with libraries to little or no experience. In general, students had a limited view of the role of librarians in the library.

The approach was trialled through the project Passport to Study with 98 new international students at a Queensland University in 2015 to support the university’s First Year Experience programme. Drawing upon contemporary flipped learning pedagogy, it aimed to raise international students’ awareness of the library as a supportive social learning space and develop foundational information and academic literacies. Although a relatively small-scale project, it provides an authentic model of cross-divisional student-focused collaboration between librarians, academic skills advisers and lecturers. After a brief literature review, the paper explains how the project team developed and implemented the flipped library orientation that involved international students in a self-guiding library quest and follow-up briefing. Evaluation findings of the flipped library orientation highlight its strengths and limitations and support a set of recommendations for further developing this innovative approach. The final discussion suggests opportunities for further pedagogical development and research. The insights gained through this project will be of potential interest to library managers, librarians and information literacy educators. They could inform innovative initiatives to support the successful transition to university of first-year students across culturally diverse university populations.

With growing enrolment of Chinese students in North America, the question of how best to enhance these students' learning experiences through library instruction and services is increasingly important. In this study, researchers recruited 17 participants (eight native Chinese-speaking and nine native English-speaking students) from a communication in engineering course at McGill University, and conducted a preliminary interview, an online survey, and an in-depth interview to gather data about each student's research experience. The online survey findings, which were used to inform the in-depth interview questions, were reported in a previous publication. The current article presents the qualitative findings from the in-depth interviews only. Findings show that native Chinese-speaking students have unique information-related challenges in the areas of searching, evaluating information, reading, writing, and citing. Challenges with specific elements of searching (such as locating full text) and writing (such as creating an outline) were shared among members of both groups. Recommendations for librarians, engineering instructors, and staff in other units serving international students are also provided.

Through an analysis of the conflict between WikiLeaks and the US government on the tactical and structural levels, it reveals a contemporary dynamic of the territory–technology nexus of network control. From the perspective of the security establishment, the free speech aspect in the WikiLeaks case is tangential; the publication of sensitive information is just one of the many undesirable consequences of anonymity. Solutions to the problem so defined include the overhaul of the Pentagon’s network or “the Internet minus the anonymity,” which, if realized, will shape the future of the Internet.","2013-05-01","2024-09-24 17:54:02","2024-09-24 17:54:02","","489-505","","4","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the @One service environment as a case study. The service and staffing model employed a sample of 20 students and professionals who work at the @One desk. Attitudes toward the @One space were assessed through one-on-one interviews using two different interview protocols. Participants were asked open-ended questions that allowed them to talk at length in response. Findings - It is found that the University of Nevada, Reno's Mathewson-IGT Knowledge Center has implemented a highly interactive service environment in support of production-intensive information technologies.

It aims to give a summary overview of the current research on international students and library outreach and to introduce and contextualize the three articles. Design/methodology/approach - This paper frames the three articles and places them in the context of the exhaustive literature on the topic. Findings - International students are not all alike. Grouping all of these students together under the umbrella term of ""international student"" contributes little, if at all, to the understanding of their real needs and problems. Practical implications - This paper suggests that there are still areas for further exploration on the topic of international students and library outreach. Originality/value - This paper argues with the oversimplified and generalized approach to international students, and suggests that it is not the most useful way to assist individual students.

The Research Library Leadership Fellows (RLLF) Program takes a new approach to succession planning by engaging a select group of sponsoring libraries, approximately 20 emergent leaders, and the membership of the Association Research Libraries working collaboratively over a 2-year period. This approach assumes a well-developed set of management and leadership skills on the part of the fellow. The program focuses instead on deepening the fellow's understanding of core strategic challenges facing senior library leaders in a wide variety of campus settings. The RLLF embraces 3 5-day, on-campus institutes, 1-2 site visits to sponsoring libraries, and participation in the semiannual Association of Research Libraries (ARL) membership meetings. The program also provides network-building among the fellows, Web-based sessions on key issues, and access to ARL member-library directors as colleagues and potential mentors. To date, more than 60 librarians from ARL member libraries have participated in the program.

Developing a good partnership requires an understanding of the teaching faculty's perspectives. This paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach — A survey was sent to business teaching faculty at California State Universities to determine their expectations in regards to student information literacy skills. Findings — Writing a report or project that required in-depth research is one of the major expectations. All faculty surveyed expect students to use library research for their assignments. Originality/value — Business faculty and librarians will be able to use these findings in developing guidelines to integrate information literacy into coursework, assignments and research tools.

Private sector research, however, indicates support for a rationale relating to overall organizational success. Such research forms the basis for the consideration of the relationship between diversity and organizational success in the academic environment. In addition, the research provides evidence that diversity continues to be valued in the private sector, which employs many of the graduates whose academic preparation is supported by the college or university library. This article presents the results of a research study involving diversity and organizational success in the academic environment. The results provide evidence that there is a relationship between diversity and organizational success and offers further support for the results of the prior research in this area, as well as offering data to enhance the rationale for the support of diversity efforts in the academic library community.

This article represents the results of a study of leadership diversity in large, urban public libraries. In the study of members of the Urban Libraries Council, data were gathered with regard to programs related to diversity awareness, staffing, collections, and information services. The research results indicate that diversity-related activities and programs have been implemented in a high percentage of the libraries. However, the level of focus on areas such as retention has not been as consistent, as is the case with the provision of library services and collection development, for example. The research results also indicate the relationship between organizational leadership and administrative structure and activities related to operationalizing diversity in public libraries.

Many policies and frameworks have a user-centered approach. However, there is little focus on encouraging diverse service providers in the library. The aim of this study is to determine the strategic approaches that academic libraries are using in their efforts to recruit and retain diverse librarians. Systematic review methodology involved searching Library & Information Science Abstracts, Library & Information Science Source, Gender Studies Database, Race Relations Abstracts, Google, and grey literature composed primarily of information from library associations’ and organizations’ websites. The primary search terms (and their variations) include diversity, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomics, academic library, librarians, recruitment, and retention. Publications were included if they were about the recruitment and/or retention strategies used by academic libraries to improve diversity among librarians. Nineteen publications and one ALA website were included in the review. All 20 publications were based in a North American context, and the interventions included targeted recruitment strategies, internship or residency programs, mentor- ship, and professional development opportunities. Using a modified version of the CASP Qualitative Checklist, the publications were critically appraised to evaluate the validity of the findings. Fifty percent of the publications included an assessment component to determine the value of the intervention. Although a number of programs exist to recruit minorities to academic librarianship, the number of visible minorities in the field has remained stagnant for decades.","2020-01-08","2024-09-24 17:54:02","2024-09-24 17:54:02","2022-04-09 17:59:25","","","","","","","Diversity Initiatives to Recruit and Retain Academic Librarians","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","crl.acrl.org","","","","","https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/download/17484/32062","Academic Librarians; Diversity; Recruitment Strategies; Retention Strategies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
