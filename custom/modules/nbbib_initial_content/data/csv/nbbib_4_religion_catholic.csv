Using the discipline of folklore, but with an awareness of the contributions of history and anthropology, it explores both positive and negative depictions of the priest's role as religious and cultural leader, community icon, hero and villain. The thesis argues that these complex folkloric representations express a nuanced ""counterclericalism"" that extends the concept of ""anticlericalism"" as developed by anthropologists and historians, and that communally accepted counterclerical narratives create a venue for discourse on the nature of power in general. I propose that the term counterclericalism is better suited to the folkloristic study of vernacular expressions of criticism of clergy, suggesting that the term ""anticlericalism"" be reserved for other uses.","2012","2022-01-19 18:32:56","2022-01-19 18:32:56","","","228","","","","","","","","","","Memorial University of Newfoundland (Canada)","St. John's, NL","English","","Ph.D.","MemU","","","","","","/home/cvillami/Zotero/storage/XNLFUAB3/McDavid - 2012 - Counterclericalism Vernacular Commentary on the P.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; New Brunswick; Nova Scotia; Catholic; Counterclericalism; Newfoundland and Labrador; Priest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the years leading to the creation of the Dominion of Canada, the Acadians from the Maritimes provinces strongly opposed the proposed confederation. Notably, in New Brunswick, many Acadian constituencies rejected the union of the provinces, even when their religious superiors advocated its adoption. What reasons motivated the Acadian elite to refuse Confederation while the Catholic Church and the French Canadians saw it as an advantageous repositioning? And how did the newly emerged Acadian elite from Collège Saint-Joseph continue to shape Acadian identity while navigating around this new level of government after 1867?
