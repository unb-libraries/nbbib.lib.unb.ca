The estrangement of the region's aboriginal population from white arenas of social valuation provides a point of departure for this historical analysis of pre-Confederation Mi'kmaq-white relations; and the religious life of both peoples provides the raw material from which is constructed an understanding of both the evolution of alienated forms of existence in this context, and the possibility of freedom from these. With an initial assumption that religion is the mode by which human beings orient themselves in the world so as to ensure that their existence is meaningful, this analysis focuses on the human relationship with landscape in colonial Acadia. It is the fundamental need to feel 'at home' that is explored in respect to both aboriginal and white populations; and the religious symbols and myths that arise out of this necessity betray the emergence of two distinct forms of human alienation that of the Mi'kmaq from white colonial society, and that of whites from an authentic appreciation of the place in which they are situated. The dissertation concludes with suggestions for constructively utilizing knowledge of the religious structures that underpin the historical fact of New World alienation.","1994","2022-01-19 18:33:23","2022-01-19 18:33:23","","","209","","","","","","","","","","University of Ottawa","Ottawa, ON","English","","Ph.D.","LAC","","","","","","/home/cvillami/Zotero/storage/ICMSV4A2/Reid - 1994 - No man's land British and Mi'kmaq in 18th and 19t.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; nineteenth century; Social sciences; New Brunswick; alienation; eighteenth century; landscape; Nova Scotia; Prince Edward Island; religion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Government officials and missionaries agreed that in order to “civilize and Christianize"" Aboriginal children, it was necessary to separate them from their parents and their home communities. For children, life in these schools was lonely and alien. Discipline was harsh, and daily life was highly regimented. Aboriginal languages and cultures were denigrated and suppressed. Education and technical training too often gave way to the drudgery of doing the chores necessary to make the schools self-sustaining. Child neglect was institutionalized, and the lack of supervision created situations where students were prey to sexual and physical abusers. Legal action by the schools’ former students led to the creation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada in 2008. The product of over six years of research, the Commission’s final report outlines the history and legacy of the schools, and charts a pathway towards reconciliation. Canada’s Residential Schools: The History, Part 1, Origins to Indigenous people, Residential schools, 1939 places Canada’s residential school system in the historical context of  European campaigns to colonize and convert Indigenous people throughout the world. In post-Confederation Canada, the government adopted what amounted to a policy of cultural genocide: suppressing spiritual practices, disrupting traditional economies, and imposing new forms of government. Residential schooling quickly became a central element in this policy. The destructive intent of the schools was compounded by chronic underfunding and ongoing conflict between the federal government and the church missionary societies that had been given responsibility for their day-to-day operation. A failure of leadership and resources meant that the schools failed to control the tuberculosis crisis that gripped the schools for much of this period. Alarmed by high death rates, Aboriginal parents often refused to send their children to the schools, leading the government adopt ever more coercive attendance regulations. While parents became subject to ever more punitive regulations, the government did little to regulate discipline, diet, fire safety, or sanitation at the schools. By the period’s end the government was presiding over a nation-wide series of firetraps that had no clear educational goals and were economically dependent on the unpaid labour of underfed and often sickly children.","2015","2022-01-19 18:33:23","2022-01-19 18:33:23","","","962","","","","","","","","","","McGill-Queen's U.P.","Montreal, QC","","","","UNBF, MtA, Dalhousie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It demonstrates that the underfunding and unsafe living conditions that characterized the early history of the schools continued into an era of unprecedented growth and prosperity for most Canadians. A miserly funding formula meant that into the late 1950s school meals fell short of the Canada Food Rules. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, and a failure to adhere to fire safety rules were common problems throughout this period. While government officials had come to view the schools as costly and inefficient, the churches were reluctant to countenance their closure. It was not until the late 1960s that the federal government finally wrested control of the system away from the churches. Government plans to turn First Nations education over to the provinces met with opposition from Aboriginal organizations that were seeking “Indian Control of Indian Education."" Following parent-led occupation of a school in Alberta, many of the remaining schools came under Aboriginal administration. The closing of the schools coincided with a growing number of convictions of former staff members on charges of sexually abusing students. These trials revealed the degree to which sexual abuse at the schools had been covered up in the past. Former students, who came to refer to themselves as Survivors, established regional and national organizations and provided much of the leadership for the campaign that led to the federal government issuing in 2008 an apology to the former students and their families.","2015","2022-01-19 18:33:23","2022-01-19 18:33:23","","","813","","","","","","","","","","McGill-Queen's U.P.","Montreal, QC","","","","UNBF, MtA, Dalhousie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tales reveal six parallel worlds in which all types of beings belong to families, have wigwams, and search for food. The parallelism between worlds has no significance for beings living their ordinary lives, but it is of the utmost importance for understanding how differing types of beings in the stories (people, animals, supernaturals) achieve interworld journeys. The notions of cosmological deixis and perspectivism are used to explore the narratives and shed light on Mi'kmaq cosmology.","2006","2022-01-19 18:33:23","2022-01-19 18:33:23","","312-336","","473","119","","","","","","","","","","","","","UIllinois","","","","","","/home/cvillami/Zotero/storage/9NSPAMCP/Hornborg - 2006 - Visiting the Six Worlds Shamanistic Journeys in C.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This exploratory study uses Mills' analytic framework to examine critically this conventional wisdom in regard to the five Native Treatment Centres in New Brunswick. This study found large variations in the use of Native spirituality in the NTCs and community conflict over the use of Native spirituality in New Brunswick NTCs. The relevant literature supports Native Traditionalists' claim that the conflict over the use of Native spirituality in drug and alcohol treatment arises from the history of missionary condemnation of Native people's spiritual beliefs. This contention is confirmed in this study by counter-example: the NTC where Native spirituality is most used is the one where it has been endorsed by visiting and local Catholic clergy. Questions are raised for further study.","1997","2022-01-19 18:33:23","2022-01-19 18:33:23","","","127","","","","","","","","","","University of New Brunswick (Canada)","Fredericton, NB","English","","M.A.","UNBF","","","","","","/home/cvillami/Zotero/storage/9FTKWKRL/Perley - 1997 - The use of Native spirituality in addiction treatm.pdf","","","Philosophy; religion and theology; Social sciences; Health and environmental sciences; Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
